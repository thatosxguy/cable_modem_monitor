# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Netgear CM3000: logout action added to catalog.** The confirmed
  CM3000 entry had no logout action, so HA never released the modem's
  single admin session — a lingering session blocked re-login when HA
  re-authenticated, surfacing as a random reconfigure failure that
  cleared only after a manual browser sign-in. Adds `actions.logout`
  (GET `/Logout.htm`, derived from the firmware's `gui_logout()`) so
  Core releases the session after each poll and before a same-poll
  auth retry. Catalog-only; reuses the existing logout primitive.
  (Related to #127)

## [3.14.0-beta.11] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **Diagnostics now report system_info field outcomes.** A mapped field
  that produces nothing on a successful poll is no longer invisible:
  the diagnostics download lists fields the modem never sent
  (`system_info_fields_missing`) and fields whose value type conversion
  rejected, with the raw value (`system_info_fields_failed`). Lets a
  field-level parsing gap be diagnosed from the first shared
  diagnostics file instead of a contributor round-trip. (Related to #98)
- **Arris S33v3 confirmed on hardware.** Verified via contributor
  diagnostics: 33 downstream + 6 upstream channels, HNAP SHA256 auth,
  ICMP health checks working. The firmware does not report uptime;
  Last Boot Time derives from counter-reset detection. (Related to #98)
- **Four more modems confirmed on hardware.** Verified via contributor
  diagnostics: Motorola MB8611 (34 DS + 4 US, restart confirmed,
  Related to #60), Arris SB6183 (16 DS + 4 US, Related to #95), Netgear
  CM3000 (34 DS + 5 US, Related to #127), and ARRIS CM3500B
  (26 DS + 5 US, Related to #73).
- **Technicolor XB10 (CGM601TCOM) added to the catalog.** DOCSIS 4.0
  hardware provisioned in 3.1 mode. Auth, channel parsing, and restart
  action config derived from a contributor HAR; awaiting hardware
  confirmation before it is marked confirmed. (Related to #173)
- **`{cookie:name}` parameter interpolation.** Action params can now
  reference session-jar cookies by name, resolved at execution time.
  Supports the Double Submit Cookie CSRF pattern needed for the XB10
  restart action. (Related to #173)

### Changed

- **Breaking: `session.max_concurrent` replaced by
  `HttpAction.requires_session`.** `max_concurrent` is removed from
  SessionConfig. The presence of `actions.logout` is now the sole
  indicator of single-session semantics. Per-action
  `requires_session: true` skips the logout-before-retry when no session
  cookie is present. Catalog YAML still using `max_concurrent` must
  migrate. (Related to #170)
- **parser.py declares its own resource needs.** A `PostProcessor` now
  declares the resources its hooks read in a `resources` class attribute
  (URL path → format), merged into the fetch list at startup. Replaces
  the former workaround of adding a fake parser.yaml field mapping just
  to force the fetch. The Sercomm DM1000 — the only catalog user of the
  workaround — has been migrated; extracted output is unchanged.

### Fixed

- **CM3500B modulation values are now canonical.** The parser.yaml
  modulation columns were typed as plain strings; downstream QAM and
  upstream ATDMA channels now emit canonical `QAM256` / `QAM64`.
  (Related to #73)

## [3.14.0-beta.10] - 2026-06-04

### Added

- **`orphaned_statistics` service.** Finds recorder statistics for a
  modem that have no registered entity — left behind by a mode switch,
  channel rebonding (ID mode), or a prefix change. Default call returns a
  commented preview of orphaned entity IDs. Pass `execute: true` to purge
  all of them directly via HA's recorder. Purge is permanent. Documented
  in TROUBLESHOOTING.md § Ghost Statistics.
- **Technicolor XB7 (CGM4331COM) now fully supported.** Verified on
  hardware via contributor HAR capture. 34 downstream + 5 upstream channels
  confirmed.

### Fixed

- **Logout before same-poll auth retry on single-session firmware.** When
  `LOAD_AUTH` or `LOAD_INTEGRITY` fires on a modem with `actions.logout`
  configured, Core now attempts a best-effort logout before clearing the
  session and retrying.
  Releases any stale server-side session (e.g. after an unclean HA restart)
  so the immediate re-authentication can succeed. Related to #170.
- **SB8200 v6 Basic: logout action added to catalog.** The `modem-basic`
  variant was missing a logout action, preventing the logout-before-retry
  path from firing. Related to #170.
- **XB7: modulation field normalized to canonical form.** The XB7 firmware
  reports upstream modulation as `"64QAM"` where the catalog expects
  `"qam_64"`. The parser now normalizes at intake so modulation values are
  consistent across modem families. Addresses #107.

## [3.14.0-beta.9] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **XB6/XB7: upstream OFDMA channels now correctly classified as `ofdma`.**
  Firmware reports `Channel Type: TDMA` for OFDMA upstream channels because
  `docsIfUpChannelType` (DOCS-IF-MIB, RFC 4546) has no OFDMA value. The
  channel type is now derived from the `Modulation` field instead, matching
  the DOCSIS 3.1 spec. `symbol_rate` and the redundant modulation label are
  correctly stripped from OFDMA channels. Addresses #107.
- **XB7: malformed `<th>` HTML normalized before parsing.** Firmware emits
  `<th>Label</td><td>value</td>` — unclosed `<th>` tags that cause
  BeautifulSoup to nest sibling cells instead of treating them as a row.
  `normalize_html()` now rewrites the tag at the input boundary so the table
  parser sees well-formed HTML. Addresses #107.
- **`inject_credential_cookie` auth: body is the credential cookie value.**
  Firmware that uses this pattern returns a server-issued session token in
  the auth response body; browser JS sets it directly as the credential
  cookie (`createCookie("credential", result)`). Core now replicates this
  correctly. An empty auth response body is treated as an error — there is
  no btoa fallback. Related to #170.

### Added

- **`inject_credential_cookie` field for `url_token` auth.** When set,
  Core sets `cookie_name` to the server-issued token from the auth response
  body after login. Use for firmware where the server never issues the
  credential cookie via `Set-Cookie` and the browser JS reads the token from
  the response body instead.
- **SB8200 `modem-basic` golden file regression test.** `modem-basic.har`
  now carries a synthetic auth response body so `test_modem_har_replay`
  exercises the full auth → fetch → parse pipeline for this variant.

## [3.14.0-beta.8] - 2026-05-29

### Fixed

- **Two-phase TLS probe for cipher-floor incompatibility.** Standard Python
  SSL is tried first; `SECLEVEL=0` is the fallback only when standard SSL
  fails. `legacy_ssl=True` when standard fails but `SECLEVEL=0` succeeds,
  covering both old TLS versions and TLS 1.2 modems whose cipher suites
  fall below Python's default security floor. Related to #170.

### Added

- **Field-set change detection for `system_info`.** The orchestrator
  now logs a WARNING when parser-level `system_info` fields appear or
  disappear between polls. Surfaces silent firmware-induced regressions
  (e.g., a CSS selector miss after a modem firmware update) that previously
  went undetected.

### Changed

- **Standardization of `boot_status` (Tier 2).** Renamed `provisioning_status`
  to `boot_status` in the Compal CH7465MT parser.
- **Documentation: `FIELD_REGISTRY.md` expanded.** Registered `model_name`
  in Tier 2; added `dhcp_status`, `tftp_status`, and `internet_access` to
  prevent field fragmentation across manufacturer-specific diagnostic pages.
  Renamed `fft_size` to `fft_type` in the field registry to match parser usage.
- **Standardization of `channel_width` (Tier 2).** Renamed `width` to
  `channel_width` across all parsers (SB8200, TC4400) and synchronized
  with the Tier 2 naming authority.
- **Standardization of `model_name` (Tier 2).** Renamed `model` to
  `model_name` in the Arris CM820B, TM1602A, Technicolor CGA2121, and
  Sercomm DM1000 parsers. Updated the confirmed `arris/cm820b` verified
  artifact.
- **Standardization of `ranging_status` (Tier 2).** Renamed `us_ranging_status`
  to `ranging_status` in the Technicolor CGA2121 parser.

## [3.14.0-beta.7] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- **Arris SB8200 `modem-basic` variant (URL Token, v6 hardware).** Added
  catalog entry for the v6 hardware variant (firmware AB01.01.009.51).
  Auth mechanism confirmed in Unreleased. Status: `awaiting_verification`.
  Related to #170.
- **`ModemSnapshot.to_event_payload()` and HA event bus integration.** Core
  now produces a structured `EventBusPayload` (model, ISP, status, channel
  counts, collection timestamp) on every successful poll. The HA coordinator
  fires this as the `cable_modem_monitor_data_updated` event, enabling
  downstream integrations to consume live modem data without coordinator
  coupling. Related to #169.

### Changed

- **Orchestration logging migrated to typed `OrchestratorEvent` dataclasses.**
  All log output from the orchestration layer now flows through a single
  `log_event()` adapter. No runtime behavior change.
- **HA adapter: dev tools extracted to `dev_tools.py`.** `async_request_modem_refresh`,
  service registration, and related utilities moved from `services.py` into a
  dedicated module. No behavior change.

## [3.14.0-beta.6] - 2026-05-22

### Breaking Changes

- **Arris SB8200 `variant: v7` config entries will fail on
  startup.** `modem-v7.yaml` was renamed internally to `modem-cookie.yaml`.
  Delete and re-add the integration to fix it.

### Added

- **Bearer token auth strategy (`auth.strategy: bearer`).** Supports
  RFC 6750 `Authorization: Bearer <token>` authentication for modems
  using token-based REST APIs. Virgin SuperHub 5 uses this path for
  its restart action.
- **Per-action auth (`action_auth`) on `HttpAction`.** Restart (and
  future) actions can carry independent credentials without touching
  the monitoring session. A fresh session is authenticated and
  discarded after the action. Modems with `auth.strategy: none` for
  monitoring but bearer-protected restart endpoints use this path
  (e.g., Virgin SuperHub 5). Config flow shows credential fields
  when `action_auth` is set on any restart action.
- **Virgin SuperHub 5 restart action.** `actions.restart` block added
  to `virgin/superhub5/modem.yaml` (bearer `action_auth`, sourced
  from issue #82). HAR verification pending — needs a contributor
  capture to confirm http vs https and username field handling. Related to #82.
- **`ModemStatus` StrEnum replacing `Literal[...]` in Core schema.**
  Values: `confirmed`, `awaiting_verification`, `unsupported`.
  Imported from `models` package. Closes future drift at the Pydantic
  gate. Catalog tools and config index updated in lockstep.
- **Per-variant `*` markers in config-flow variant dropdown.**
  Unconfirmed variants are labeled with `*` (e.g.,
  `SB8200 Cookie (v6)*`). A translation footer explaining the
  marker appears in all 12 supported locales. The model-level
  rollup shows `*` only when every variant in every sibling
  directory is unconfirmed.
- **Catalog tools: missing Tier-1 `system_info` fields flagged at
  golden-file generation.** `generate_golden_file` returns
  `missing_system_info_fields` — the diff of `SYSTEM_INFO_FIELDS`
  against what the parser extracted. A non-empty list means the
  HAR has data the parser isn't capturing; the onboarding workflow
  now instructs contributors to inspect the HAR and add the mapping
  before proceeding. Closes the gap where `system_uptime` was absent
  from `netgear/c7000v2` and `netgear/c3700` at authoring time but
  only caught at confirmation. Related to #163.
- **Restart action test harness auto-discovery.** `RestartTestCase`,
  `discover_restart_tests`, and `run_modem_restart_test` added to
  Core's test harness. The catalog test suite picks these up
  automatically — adding restart coverage for a modem means adding
  `test_data/modem-restart.har`. No test code changes needed. Two
  HAR sources (first match wins): dedicated `modem-restart.har`, or
  `modem.har` when `modem.yaml` declares `actions.restart`.
- **Catalog README auth strategy badges and render_readme.** Each
  modem row now shows a color-coded badge for its auth strategy
  (grouped by family: No auth / Simple / Form-based / Token-based /
  Protocol). `render_readme: true` added to `hacs.json` so the
  catalog README renders as the HACS store listing.
- **Chipset sourcing audit.** BCM3390 citations added for CM1200,
  CM2050v, CGA4236, and CGA6444VF (cross-model inference, sourced);
  bare "Same platform as X" stubs on S34 and MB8600 replaced with
  real URLs.

### Fixed

- **Technicolor `form_pbkdf2` modems rejected every login attempt.**
  `{"error": "ok"}` signals success on the Technicolor REST platform
  (CGA6444VF, CGA4236), but the truthy-error check treated `"ok"` as
  a failure and returned `MSG_LOGIN_1` on every attempt. New
  `login_success` field on `FormPbkdf2Auth` specifies the exact
  key-value pairs that constitute success; the existing truthy-error
  path is unchanged when `login_success` is unset. Addresses #120.
- **TCP probe analysis layer still matched HTTP GET log lines.**
  `362db673` removed the HTTP GET probe and promoted TCP connect as
  the primary L4 signal, but `log_parser.py` kept the old regex
  (`HTTP GET Xms, N bytes`) — real TCP probe logs were silently
  dropped. Regex updated to match the current `ICMP Xms, TCP Yms`
  format. `HealthEvent.http_ms` renamed to `tcp_ms` throughout the
  analysis layer. ORCHESTRATION_SPEC, ORCHESTRATION_USE_CASES,
  HA_ADAPTER_SPEC, and README updated to remove stale HTTP examples.
- **PII check false-positive on credit card pattern in modem
  fixtures.** `check_fixture_pii` flagged valid hex MAC/channel data
  as Visa card numbers. False positive suppressed for cable modem
  fixture context.
- **Netgear C3700 uptime field false-positive IPv6 redaction.** HAR
  capture included an uptime string that tripped the IP redaction
  regex; fixture corrected.

### Confirmed

- **Arris SB8200 HNAP** — verified on hardware by @inventor7777
  on TB01 firmware, Cox ISP, hardware version v6. Addresses #165.
- **Netgear C7000v2** — verified on hardware (beta.5 diagnostics).
  `system_uptime` parser added (RouterStatus.htm offset 33).
  Addresses #163.

## [3.14.0-beta.5] - 2026-05-20

### Fixed

- **HA install failure: Core dependency floors exceeded HA's pinned versions.**
  `requests>=2.34.2` and `pyyaml>=6.0.3` in Core's `pyproject.toml` both
  exceeded HA 2025.1.x pins (`requests==2.32.3`, `PyYAML==6.0.2`), causing uv
  to fail with "No solution found" on every fresh install. Floors lowered to
  `requests>=2.31.0` and `pyyaml>=6.0.0`. Addresses beta.4 install regression.

### Added

- **HA dependency compatibility gate.** `scripts/check_ha_compat.py` validates
  that every floor declared in Core and Catalog `pyproject.toml` is satisfiable
  under HA's `package_constraints.txt`. Wired into `make validate-ci` and the
  `ha-compat-check` CI job so this class of regression is caught before push.

## [3.14.0-beta.4] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- **Per-minute error rate sensors (#164).** SC-QAM `rate_corrected`
  and `rate_uncorrected` fields (errors/min) in `system_info`,
  derived by the orchestrator from inter-poll deltas on a monotonic
  clock. Two new HA sensors (`Rate Corrected Errors`, `Rate
  Uncorrected Errors`, MEASUREMENT state class) materialize whenever
  the modem reports SC-QAM error counters; a per-counter zero-floor
  rule means a total of `0` produces rate `0.0` immediately, so a
  fresh modem with no errors reads `0.0` rather than `unknown` from
  the first poll. Otherwise the sensors read `unknown` until the
  second poll fills the delta. Rate history graphs are opt-in via a
  new `include_error_rates` service option (default `false`); the
  default dashboard is unchanged. SC-QAM scope only; OFDM rates are
  future work per the DOCS-IF31-MIB boundary rule in PARSING_SPEC
  § Aggregate. Surfaces what users in #110, #144, and #161 were
  assembling with HA's `derivative` integration.
- **Modulation canonicalization elevated to core.** New
  `type: modulation` field type auto-canonicalizes raw values
  (`256QAM` → `QAM256`) via the shared helper — one source of
  truth instead of per-modem map blocks. Paired with
  `channel_type: derive: from_modulation`, the universal
  direction-aware rule (DS `QAM*` → `qam`, US `QAM*` → `atdma`,
  OFDM/OFDMA stand alone) replaces enumerated per-modem
  channel-type maps. Catalog migrations: cm820b, tg3442de,
  tm1602a, coda56 (DS keeps a source-code-to-value map layered
  under the new type for the modem-specific 1→QAM64 / 2→QAM256
  translation), ch7465mt. `XMLColumnMapping` gained `map:`
  support along the way, closing a format gap.
- **Spec-conformance gate against committed goldens.**
  `validate_modem_data` runs against `modem.expected.json` for
  every `status: confirmed` modem and asserts conformance with
  `PARSING_SPEC`. 16 fixture-driven cases plus inline helper
  coverage. Catches non-canonical modulation drift at PR time
  rather than at runtime. `awaiting_verification` modems are
  not enforced (parsers still iterating).
- **Optional-segment uptime format.** Uptime parsers now accept
  format strings with bracketed optional segments
  (e.g., `[{days} days ]{hours}:{minutes}:{seconds}`), so a single
  declarative format can match both `2 days 03:14:15` and `03:14:15`
  when the modem omits days under one day. Unified the cm2000 and
  cm3000 uptime declarations on this shared format.
- **Config-flow variant picker groups cross-directory modem
  variants.** SB8200 HTML, HNAP, and CBN variants now appear as a
  single "Arris SB8200" entry in the picker; choosing one opens a
  sub-picker for the variant. Hardware version (`hw_version`) read
  from `hardware.hw_version` in the catalog appears as "(v6)" or
  "(v7)" in the variant label so users can match against the modem
  sticker. `firmware` moves to `hardware.firmware`; `hw_version`
  removed from the top-level model config. Catalog README gains a
  CBN badge column and shows `hw_version` in the model column to
  disambiguate duplicate rows.

### Fixed

- **Netgear C7000v2 Basic Auth — 401 on every authenticated
  request.** Firmware requires the `XSRF_TOKEN` cookie (set on
  the initial `GET /`) to accompany every subsequent
  `Authorization: Basic` header. Enabled `challenge_cookie: true`
  in the C7000v2 `modem.yaml` — same pattern already shipping
  for the CM1200 HTTPS variant. Addresses #163 (thanks to
  @Anthranilic for the fresh HAR capture).
- **Compal CH7465MT upstream `channel_type` miscoded as `qam`.**
  Corrected to `atdma` as part of the modulation canonicalization
  migration. Longstanding miscoding — upstream DOCSIS 3.0 SC-QAM
  carriers are A-TDMA, not QAM.
- **9 CodeQL code-scanning alerts.** Implicit string
  concatenation in `services.py` and `generate_catalog_index.py`
  converted to explicit `+`; ineffectual `await` in
  `test_sensor_entities.py` marked explicit. Catalog README
  byte-identical after regeneration; no behavior change.
- **v1 to v2 migration: sibling variants missed; Ping and HTTP
  Latency sensors absent post-upgrade.** `resolve_variant` only
  walked the primary modem directory, missing variants defined in
  sibling directories (SB8200 CBN, HNAP, url_token). `supports_icmp`
  and `supports_head` were omitted from the migrated entry;
  `sensor.py` gates Ping and HTTP Latency sensor creation on those
  keys, so both were silently absent after upgrade. Both keys now
  default `True`; runtime health probing corrects false positives.
  Addresses #143.
- **Error rate baseline not cleared on `reset_auth()`.** The
  post-reset poll computed a rate across the auth-outage interval
  rather than emitting no-baseline. `reset_auth()` now clears the
  prior-state baseline. Related to #164.

### Changed

- **Catalog tools field registry expanded.** New vocabulary entries
  map non-standard modem headers to canonical fields without pipeline
  code changes: `Channel Index` to `channel_number`, `Received Level`
  and `Transmit Level` to `power`, `SNR/MER Threshold Value` to
  `snr`, and `Modulation/Profile ID` to `modulation`. HNAP
  `_run_pass1` now skips degenerate all-counters rows. Fleet accuracy
  improves from 72.3% to 74.0%; TC4400 per-modem accuracy from 60.8%
  to 98.6%.
- **Arris SB8200 CBN variant directory renamed from `sb8200v3` to
  `sb8200-cbn`.** No confirmed installations. Directory name now
  reflects transport rather than hardware revision, consistent with
  `sb8200-hnap`.

### Confirmed

- **Arris S33** — verified on real hardware by @ccpk1 on
  firmware `TB01.03.001.11_051722_212.S3` (32 DS + 4 US locked,
  all signals nominal). `modem.har` refreshed from his sanitized
  capture (114 entries, full reboot flow, all diagnostic
  screens); `modem.expected.json` regenerated against the
  existing curated `parser.yaml`; `modem.verified.json` added
  from his diagnostics. S33v2 and S33v3 remain
  `awaiting_verification` — each needs an independent
  confirmation. Related to #146, #140.

## [3.14.0-beta.3] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- **`verify_diagnostics` catalog tool.** Pure function plus thin CLI
  in `cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools` that takes an HA diagnostics
  JSON and a release tag and produces a properly-shaped
  `verified.json` fixture (HA wrapper unwrapped, integration extras
  stripped, `verified_at`/`version` prepended, channel arrays
  rendered compact, multi-variant paths resolved). Replaces the
  hand-rolled python heredoc previously used at confirmation time
  with a deterministic, tested transform. Imports
  `SYSTEM_INFO_FIELDS` and `canonicalize_channel_keys` from the
  core registry to keep the field-list and channel-key-order
  truth in one place. Maintainer-facing; no end-user impact. See
  `MODEM_INTAKE_WORKFLOW.md` § Confirmation Phase.
- **`json_transposed` parser format.** New format for modems that
  expose channel data as transposed JSON tables (rows are fields,
  columns are channels). Lives in `core/parsers/formats/` alongside
  the existing `html_table`, `xml`, and `json_table` formats and
  registers through the centralized format registry so new formats
  compose in additively. Surfaces to contributors via modem.yaml
  `format:` selection.
- **OFDM/OFDMA `frequency` semantic pinned in FIELD_REGISTRY.md.**
  The same canonical field carries different physical meaning across
  channel types — SC-QAM `frequency` is the carrier center; OFDM
  and OFDMA `frequency` is the **lower edge of the active subcarrier
  band**. Documented with the spectrum-overlap evidence (CM2050V
  690 MHz overlaps SC-QAM at 642–651 MHz if interpreted as center)
  and the matching DOCSIS 3.1 OSSI MIB. New OFDM/OFDMA contributions
  map whichever firmware key lands at the lower edge to canonical
  `frequency`; per-firmware shape is mechanism, not concept.
- **`range: span` mapping operator for fan-out from one source
  field.** Splits a separator-delimited raw value and computes
  `last - first`, used by TG3442DE to derive `channel_width` from
  the same `Frequency` key that also supplies `frequency`
  (`"751~860"` → `frequency=751_000_000 Hz`,
  `channel_width=109_000_000 Hz`). Silently skips rows where the
  raw isn't range-shaped (numeric SC-QAM rows in the same table
  pass through without WARN). Bound checking surfaces reversed
  ranges and non-numeric edges as WARN logs. See
  `JsonChannelMapping.range` and `_compute_span` in
  `parsers/formats/json_parser.py`.
- **Silent-fail WARN surfacing for un-coercible channel field
  values.** When a non-empty raw value fails to coerce after any
  declared transform, `_extract_channel` now WARN-logs the field
  name + raw + type rather than DEBUG-logging silently. Catches
  novel firmware shapes (the TG3442DE `"751~860"` case) without
  requiring users to enable DEBUG. Sparse data (None, empty
  strings) continues to skip silently.
- **`channel_width` Tier 2 field, first populator: TG3442DE.**
  Registered in FIELD_REGISTRY.md since the dual-OFDM era; now
  carries actual data. Hz-valued integer matching the established
  `frequency` unit convention.
- **Fleet field-completeness regression test
  (`test_channel_field_completeness.py`).** Parser.yaml-driven:
  for each modem, walks `parser.yaml` to find which canonical
  fields it maps for which channel_types, then asserts every
  locked channel of those types in `modem.expected.json` carries
  those fields. Closes the regression-blindness loop where parser
  output was compared against a golden file generated by the same
  parser. Modems whose firmware genuinely doesn't expose a field
  (and whose parser.yaml correctly omits the mapping) pass without
  false alarms — distinguishes parser drops from firmware gaps.
  Caught the TG3442DE and g54 silent drops; technicolor/cga2121
  (firmware HTML lacks a frequency column) and virgin/superhub5
  (REST API exposes `firstActiveSubcarrier` and `channelWidth`
  but no OFDM frequency) are firmware gaps and pass naturally.
- **SB8200 catalog fixtures exercising both auth-manager
  extraction branches against the same AB01 firmware variant.**
  `arris/sb8200/test_data/modem.har` is the post-sanitization
  Travis #81 HAR (login response body stripped to empty) —
  exercises the cookie-fallback branch where `_extract_token`
  returns the cookie value when the body is empty.
  `modem-body-token.har` is a synthetic capture of the same
  firmware's actual production wire shape — 31-byte session
  token in the login response body, matching Travis's
  `bodySize: 31` and dtaubert's v3.13.0-beta.5 wire trace.
  Both exercise the active `modem.yaml` (login_prefix=`login_`,
  token_prefix=`ct_`, cookie_name=`sessionId`); together they
  pin the two `_extract_token` branches against runtime drift.
  Replaces the previous `modem.har` which was no-auth-shaped
  and passed only because of the test harness Tier 2 routing bug
  (see Fixed).

### Fixed

- **CodeQL `py/insecure-protocol` alert (high severity)** on
  `connectivity._tls_handshake` — suppressed via
  `codeql-config.yml` query-filter with rationale. The TLS
  handshake accepts legacy protocol versions on the *probe* path
  to detect what older modem firmware speaks; the runtime
  data-fetch path uses the legacy adapter only when the probe
  negotiated legacy. Documented architectural decision, same
  family as the existing `py/request-without-cert-validation`
  exclusion.
- **CodeQL `py/bad-tag-filter` alert (high severity)** on
  `catalog_tools/analysis/js_endpoints.py` — regex tightened
  from `</script\s*>` to `</script\b[^>]*>` so HTML5 end-tag
  variants (`</script foo>`, `</script/>`,
  `</script\t\n bar>`) match correctly. Module docstring
  documents the regex-vs-`bs4+lxml` tradeoff and the residual
  blindspots accepted as tech debt (unterminated tags, literal
  `</script>` in JS strings, CDATA wrapping, HTML-commented
  scripts).
- **Redundant `import logging`** removed from
  `tests/components/test_log_buffer.py` (already imported at
  module top). Closes CodeQL `py/repeated-import` alert.
- **Auth failure logs now surface response detail across all
  strategies.** `_log_auth_failure_detail` (collector.py) reads
  `auth_result.response` to emit sanitized request line + response
  status/Content-Type + body snippet on auth failure. Six strategies
  (`form_pbkdf2`, `form_sjcl`, `form_cbn`, `form_nonce`, `hnap`,
  `url_token`) plus the shared `parse_json_dict` helper now populate
  `response=` on failure paths where a `requests.Response` is in
  scope; previously only `form` did, so contributors triaging auth
  failures on any other strategy saw the no-response one-line
  fallback. Related to #120 (CGA6444VF — first real-world test of
  `form_pbkdf2`).
- **Stale HNAP sessions now recover within the same poll.** When a
  cached HNAP session is rejected by the server (LOAD_AUTH on
  HTTP 401/404), the orchestrator clears the cached session and
  retries collection once in the same poll instead of surfacing a
  transient `auth_failed` state. Affects modems whose firmware
  expires sessions faster than the configured poll interval (e.g.,
  Arris S33 with sub-10-minute auth timeout). Related to #140.
- **Adaptive session reuse disable for chronically short-TTL
  firmware.** After 2 consecutive recovered same-poll LOAD_AUTH
  events, the orchestrator stops attempting cached-session reuse for
  the rest of the runtime and starts each poll with a fresh login.
  An intervening normal successful poll resets the recovery streak.
  Runtime-only — `reset_auth()` or process restart re-enables reuse.
  Surfaces in diagnostics as `stale_session_recovery_streak` and
  `session_reuse_disabled`. Strategy is intentionally not exposed
  as a per-modem yaml field (per the "no per-modem recovery tuning"
  principle).
- **CM1200 silent `no_signal` for ~8 minutes after fresh re-add
  (#151).** Some cable modems serve a stub HTML page (HTTP 200,
  page chrome with no data section) on data URLs when the firmware
  is in an ambiguous auth state — typically when a stale session
  is still alive on the modem-side after the integration is
  re-added. The integration's loader gate only flagged login pages
  with a `<input type="password">` field; a stub without one slipped
  through, the parser logged warnings about every missing JS
  function anchor, returned empty channels, and the orchestrator
  reported `no_signal` as if the modem were online but unsynced.
  The reporter sat in that silent state until the modem eventually
  returned 401 and the existing `LOAD_AUTH` recovery path kicked in.
  The new `LOAD_INTEGRITY` collector signal closes the gap: the
  parser coordinator now reports per-resource expected-vs-fulfilled
  anchor counts, and the collector raises `LOAD_INTEGRITY` when any
  resource has expected anchors > 0 and fulfilled = 0. Treated
  identically to `LOAD_AUTH` (clear session, retry once in same
  poll, increment auth streak, surface as `auth_failed`) so
  recovery happens on the very next poll instead of waiting for
  the modem's internal session timeout. JS-format and JS-JSON
  modems get real anchor counting; other formats report trivially
  fulfilled until the same failure shape surfaces there. UC-19a
  documents the full flow; `RESOURCE_LOADING_SPEC.md` failure-mode
  table corrected (the prior text predicted `PARSE_ERROR` for
  this case, which never matched the actual silent-`no_signal`
  behavior).
- **Catalog Tools intake produced configs that failed Core
  validation — `session.max_concurrent: 1 requires actions.logout`
  (#151 stretch).** The session inference and action detection are
  independent passes in `catalog_tools/analyze_har`. When the
  session pass inferred IP-based single-session tracking but the
  HAR didn't include a logout request, the assembler set
  `max_concurrent: 1` without an accompanying `actions.logout`,
  producing a modem.yaml the Core validator correctly rejected
  (single-session without logout would lock users out). The
  cross-block constraint now lives in the assembler: when
  `max_concurrent: 1` is inferred but no logout endpoint was
  detected, drop the inference. Contributors capturing a new
  modem must include a logout flow before the integration treats
  it as single-session. Unblocked netgear/cm2000 in the regression
  pipeline.
- **Arris S33 reboot now succeeds — and the same fix propagated to
  S33v2, S33v3, and S34 (#146).** The Arris HNAP firmware rejects a
  bare `Action=reboot` payload; the modem requires a full
  `SetArrisConfigurationInfo` body that preserves the current EEE
  and LED state. Catalog reboot actions on all four siblings now
  carry `SetEEEEnable: ${ethSWEthEEE:0}` and
  `LED_Status: ${LedStatus:1}`, interpolated from the existing
  `GetArrisConfigurationInfo` pre-fetch. S33 fix verified on
  hardware by the reporter (#148, ccpk1); S33v2/S33v3/S34 mirrored
  from shared firmware lineage with the executor-level default
  fallback as the safety net, pending variant validation. Related
  to #117 (S33v2), #98 (S33v3), #108 (S34).
- **TG3442DE and g54 OFDM/OFDMA `frequency` silently dropped (#86).**
  Both modems' firmwares report OFDM/OFDMA frequency in shapes the
  parser silently dropped: TG3442DE as a `"low~high"` band string
  (`float()` raised `ValueError`, the converter returned `None`, the
  field never made it into the channel dict); g54 as a discrete
  lower-edge key the parser.yaml didn't map at all. Both now
  extracted as canonical `frequency` per the convention now pinned
  in FIELD_REGISTRY.md (lower edge of the active subcarrier band
  for OFDM/OFDMA). TG3442DE additionally populates the Tier 2
  `channel_width` field via the new `range: span` operator. The
  gap on TG3442DE was invisible because `modem.expected.json` was
  generated by the same broken parser, so the regression test
  agreed with itself; the new fleet field-completeness audit
  surfaces parser drops of canonical fields independently.
- **g54 OFDM-shadow channels mis-counted as SC-QAM (#86).**
  Surfaced by spectrum-overlap geometry while reviewing the OFDM
  fix above. DOCSIS 3.1 OSSI requires every downstream channel to
  appear in the legacy `docsIfDownChannelTable` — OFDM channels
  show up there with `modulation: "unsupported"`, with the rich
  data in `docsIf31CmDsOfdmChanTable`. g54's web API mirrors that:
  the dschannel array carried both real SC-QAM and OFDM-shadow
  rows, but parser.yaml's `lock_status: "locked"` filter alone
  let the shadows through. Filter tightened to also exclude
  `modulation: "UNSUPPORTED"`, trimming 2 ghost SC-QAM rows per
  poll. The DOCSIS-shadow pattern is documented in
  `cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools/docs/ONBOARDING_SPEC.md` so
  future contributors hitting the same shape on a new modem find
  the answer in the intake spec.
- **dm1000 OFDM/OFDMA `frequency` dropped (#86).** Sercomm
  firmware exposes a single value (`OFDMFreq` downstream,
  `Center Freq SC0` upstream) with no subcarrier metadata; the
  test HAR's downstream value (827.6 MHz) overlaps real SC-QAM
  channels at 825-861 MHz, which is physically impossible if it
  were the active-band lower edge. Most likely the CMTS-assigned
  channel placement frequency (same concept as the DOCSIS legacy
  shadow frequency in g54). Removed the mapping to the canonical
  `frequency` field — reporting nothing beats misreporting
  placement-as-edge. dm1000 is `awaiting_verification`, so this
  moves test fixtures only.
- **cm3500b OFDM/OFDMA `frequency` was the band center (#86).**
  The PostProcessor in `arris/cm3500b/parser.py` averaged
  `first_subcarrier_freq` and `last_subcarrier_freq` from the
  HTML table to produce a band-center `frequency`. Now uses the
  first subcarrier directly (lower edge per the convention).
  ``channel_width`` continues to come from the firmware bandwidth
  column. cm3500b is `awaiting_verification`, so the change moves
  test fixtures only; no user-facing data has shifted.
- **PARSING_SPEC.md "OFDM frequency = center" stale wording.**
  The example PostProcessor and the OFDM/OFDMA channel field tables
  described `frequency` as the band center; updated to the
  lower-edge convention with cross-references to FIELD_REGISTRY.md.
- **SB8200 url_token data fetch returns 0/0 channels (#81).** The
  url_token auth manager populated `AuthResult.response` and
  `AuthResult.response_url` on its token-extraction branch (body is
  a session token, not a data page). The loader's auth-response
  reuse logic — which keys on those fields — then surfaced the
  token string as the parsed data page and skipped the real
  `?ct_<token>` data fetch. The fix returns `AuthResult` from the
  token branch with `response`/`response_url` unset; only the
  data-page branch (success_indicator present in body) advertises
  reuse. Contract tightened in `AuthResult` docstring +
  ORCHESTRATION_SPEC + RESOURCE_LOADING_SPEC + MODEM_YAML_SPEC,
  with paired auth/loader unit tests pinning both branches. Bug
  present from v3.14.0-alpha.7 (d7806b0a, "G-1 url_token body
  token extraction") through beta.2.

  Symptom shape (auth success, parser finds no tables, no
  LoginPageDetectedError) matches dtaubert's 2026-05-03 beta.2
  trace; hardware verification still required to confirm the fix
  resolves #81 specifically. Full evidence chain in the commit
  message.
- **Test harness Tier 2 routing masked auth-side bugs at login_page
  paths.** When a modem's login URL and a parser-fetched data page
  share a path (SB8200 logs in at `/cmconnectionstatus.html` and
  the parser fetches `/cmconnectionstatus.html`), `_find_route`
  Tier 2 collapsed a live login GET (with sanitized credentials in
  the query) onto the bare-path data entry, handing the data page
  back as the login response. Routing now requires login GETs to
  match a captured login HAR entry (path with query); only
  token-suffixed data fetches use the bare-path fallback. Surfaced
  the SB8200 fixture mismatch above. Login-page disambiguation is
  unit-tested in `test_har_mock_server.py::TestFindRouteLoginDisambiguation`.

### Changed

- **`load_post_processor` moved out of `core.test_harness.runner`** to
  its own module, `solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_core.post_processor`.
  The function is a runtime extension-point loader (peer of
  `load_parser_config`), used by HA's setup path to import per-modem
  `parser.py` files. It was placed in `test_harness/` only because the
  test runner was the first caller; HA picked up the same import path
  when it needed the function later. Internal-only change — no behavior
  change for end users.
- **Orchestrator diagnostic field renamed: `last_poll_timestamp` →
  `last_poll_at`.** The old field stored `time.monotonic()` under
  a name that strongly implied wall-clock time but is actually
  process-uptime seconds — useless for "when did the user test"
  inspection of archived diagnostics. New field stores
  `datetime.now(UTC).isoformat()` and means what its name implies.
  Visible in `core_diagnostics` of HA diagnostics downloads. Zero
  consumers of the old field existed, so this is a clean rename.
  Existing committed `verified.json` fixtures retain the old name
  by the point-in-time-snapshot rule; new confirmations get
  `last_poll_at`.
- **Logging contract: quiet on success.** Parse-complete and other
  success-path orchestration logs fire at INFO on the first poll
  (fresh install, reconfigure, HA restart, reauth) and drop to DEBUG
  in steady-state. Operator-relevant transitions (status changes,
  adaptive-reuse state changes, counter resets) stay at INFO
  regardless of poll count. The integration's startup INFO line tells
  users where to enable DEBUG logging for per-poll detail. Liveness
  can be confirmed without DEBUG via the Diagnostics download
  (includes `last_poll_at`, streak counters, reuse state) or the
  integration page activity log. Multi-modem setups previously
  produced 144 INFO lines/day per modem; now produce one verbose
  startup block plus transitions.
- **Catalog chipset metadata filled** for Hitron CODA56 (Broadcom
  BCM3390) and Compal CH7465MT (Intel Puma DHCE2652, MTAT ISP).
  Affects badge rendering in the catalog README.

### Confirmed

- **Hitron CODA56** — BCM3390, form auth, Comcast/Xfinity. Closes #89.
- **Netgear CM1200 (basic-auth variant).** The form-auth variant
  remains awaiting verification (different contributor, different
  conditions).
- **Arris TG3442DE** — Intel Puma 7 (FHCE2752M), form_sjcl auth,
  Vodafone DE. Closes #86.

## [3.14.0-beta.2] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- **Arris TG3442DE (Vodafone DE) data fetch returned HTTP 400.**
  Modem firmware enforces a `Referer` header on AJAX endpoints —
  every working browser request in the user-supplied HAR carried it,
  but the catalog entry didn't replay it. Adds `Referer: "{base_url}/"`
  to the modem.yaml. Issue #86.
- **Setup crashed with `KeyError: 'lock_status'` on 9 catalog
  modems.** `mapping_manager` re-implemented an unlocked-channel
  nulling rule that Core's coordinator already performs on every
  poll, with stricter key-presence semantics, and crashed on the
  very key it had just confirmed absent. Affected `arris/cm820b`,
  `arris/tm1602a`, and 7 others. Removed the redundant pass; HA
  trusts Core's contract. Closes the seam with a
  catalog-wide `mapping_manager` regression test. Issue #89.

### Added

- **`{base_url}` placeholder in `session.headers`.** Header values
  resolve at session-build time, so per-deployment URLs (different
  user IPs) work for `Referer`/`Origin` headers that some modems
  validate against their own origin. See MODEM_YAML_SPEC.md.
- **Loader failure messages include outgoing request shape.** When
  `HTTPResourceLoader`, `HNAPLoader`, or `CBNLoader` hits a 4xx/5xx,
  the exception/warning includes method + full URL + headers sent,
  with session-token values redacted (`<set, len=N>`). Auth strategies
  declare their token-bearing headers via the new
  `BaseAuthManager.headers()` method — `Basic` adds `authorization`,
  `HNAP` adds `hnap_auth`, `form_sjcl`/`form_pbkdf2` add the
  configured `csrf_header`, default is `cookie`. Eliminates the
  N-round-trip "ship a theory, user retries, fail, repeat" loop
  that #86 spent four alphas on. See ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
  "Resource-load failure detail via request-shape log."
- `HealthInfo.tcp_latency_ms` field exposed in core orchestration,
  HA diagnostics, and the new `TCP Latency` sensor.
- **Options-flow cool-off window.** `HealthMonitor` now exposes
  `collection_active` and `last_collection_success_at`; the
  options-flow validation waits for a quiet window (no active
  collection, ≥5s since last success) before re-authing. Prevents
  session-contention failures on session-limited modems
  (MB7621 confirmed) when a re-auth would otherwise overlap with
  an in-flight poll.
- **`urllib3` log filter for `MissingHeaderBodySeparatorDefect`.**
  Some firmwares (SB6141 confirmed) emit `Cache-Control` with a
  non-RFC space before the colon, producing noisy
  `MissingHeaderBodySeparatorDefect` tracebacks on every poll. New
  `solentlabs.cable_modem_monitor_core.log_filters` module installs
  a `logging.Filter` at core import time that drops them. Module
  documents the pattern for future filter additions.

### Changed

- **Health probes split: ICMP (L3), TCP (L4), HEAD (latency-only).**
  Status derivation now uses ICMP + TCP only — TCP handshake to the
  modem's web port is the L4 reachability signal. HEAD timing is
  exposed as `http_latency_ms` for diagnostic value but does not
  affect status. Application-layer issues surface via slow-poll.
- **No GET fallback at fast cadence.** When a modem doesn't support
  HEAD (`supports_head=False`), the HEAD probe is skipped entirely
  rather than falling back to GET. GET timing on most embedded
  modems is bimodal (cold compute path vs warm cached path) and
  produced misleading bimodal data in the previous `HTTP Latency`
  sensor. GET-only modems now show only Ping + TCP latency sensors;
  the `HTTP Latency` sensor only appears when HEAD is verified at
  install time.
- **New `TCP Latency` sensor** (`_tcp_latency`). Always created when
  the HTTP probe is enabled, regardless of HEAD support. Replaces
  the conflated TCP-handshake-plus-HTTP-server-time number that the
  old HTTP Latency sensor exposed.
- **Single default health-check interval (30s).** The slower
  `DEFAULT_HEALTH_CHECK_INTERVAL_GET_ONLY = 60` was removed — all
  three probes (ICMP, TCP, HEAD) are lightweight, so the per-
  capability cadence differentiation is no longer needed.
- **Config-entry uniqueness keyed on entity prefix, not hostname.**
  A user can now add a different modem at the same default IP
  (e.g. swapping an MB7621 for an SB6141 for testing) as long as a
  different entity prefix is chosen. Same prefix at any host still
  blocks setup — entity ID collision is the actual concern.
- **Protocol detection rewritten to TCP probe + TLS handshake.**
  `detect_protocol` now TCP-probes :80 and :443 and runs a TLS
  handshake on :443 with a `SECLEVEL=0` broad-cipher context,
  preferring HTTPS whenever the handshake completes. `legacy_ssl`
  is observed from the negotiated TLS version (TLSv1.1 or older
  → True) instead of inferred from a failed-and-retried-with-
  weaker-ciphers attempt. Authentication runs exactly once per
  UC-86: the previous three-attempt fallback chain
  (HTTP → HTTPS → HTTPS+legacy) is removed. On single-session
  firmware the chain previously collided with its own first
  attempt and produced misleading `MSG_LOGIN_150`-style errors;
  the new flow surfaces the first error directly. Related to #120
  (awaiting user confirmation on the originating hardware).

## [3.14.0-beta.1] - 2026-04-28

First public beta of v3.14. The cumulative v3.14 changeset is
documented in the [3.14.0-alpha.17] entry below; beta.1 ships the
new distribution mechanism on top of that work.

### Changed

- **HACS distribution switched to release-asset (`zip_release: true`).**
  Each release tag attaches a `cable_modem_monitor.zip`. Smaller
  install (~120 KB vs ~3.4 MB source archive); excludes spec/dev
  files. Paired with `hide_default_branch: true` to prevent silent
  downgrades from the version selector.
- **Beta is the public-test entry tier.** Alpha is now a
  local-source-only development concept post-alpha.17 — no GitHub
  releases, no PyPI publish, no HACS visibility. Betas install
  manually via HACS → integration → Redownload → "Need a different
  version?" → Release. There is no auto-update path on betas — each
  beta is a deliberate per-version install by design.
- Documentation rewrites for the new model: README install section,
  TROUBLESHOOTING, RELEASING, HA_ADAPTER_SPEC, CONTRIBUTING, issue
  templates, MODEM_REQUEST, and catalog_tools intake docs. Catalog
  Tools framing updated from "maintainer-only" to "open to
  contributors with hardware."

### Removed

- `update.install` troubleshooting guidance. The Home Assistant
  service is not supported with this integration; use the HACS
  manual picker instead.

### Migration

- **Alpha testers on `feature/v3.14.0` branch tracking:** that path
  is no longer supported (HACS rejects branch installs once
  `zip_release` is set on the default branch). Install beta.1 via
  the manual picker described above.

## [3.14.0-alpha.17] - 2026-04-26

### Changed (developer-only — no user-facing impact)

- **Setup docs collapsed to a single canonical path.**
  `docs/setup/DEVCONTAINER.md` and `docs/setup/WSL2_SETUP.md` are
  removed; `docs/setup/GETTING_STARTED.md` is the only setup doc and
  describes one supported environment (VS Code dev container, with
  WSL2 as the Windows hosting layer). Maintaining parallel
  Local-Python / Dev-Container / WSL2 paths created drift between
  guides; collapsing to one path matches what we actually test in CI.
- **Internal restructure: catalog authoring pipeline carved out of
  Core into a repo-only package.** The modem onboarding pipeline
  (HAR analysis, YAML generation, golden-file construction, parity
  checks) has moved from `core/mcp/` to a new repo-only package
  `cable_modem_monitor_catalog_tools` that is never installed by HA
  and not published to PyPI. Two stray catalog runtime files
  (`fleet_scanner`, `trial_parser`) used only at authoring time
  moved with it. See `core/docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` §
  "catalog_tools is a developer accelerator, never a runtime dep."
- **Pydantic correctness fix:** `pydantic>=2.0` promoted from
  Core's `[mcp]` optional extra to a first-class runtime dep. The
  prior declaration was a bug — Core's `models/`,
  `validation/cross_file.py`, and `orchestration/*` import pydantic
  at runtime, but the bug was masked because HA pulls pydantic
  transitively. The `[mcp]` extra is removed. Anyone using a
  dev/CI command like `pip install -e packages/cable_modem_monitor_core[mcp,sjcl]`
  should drop the `mcp` element.
- **Contributor path restructured around AI-assisted catalog growth.**
  `MODEM_REQUEST.md` is the user-facing path (low friction, AI
  screening optional); `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the developer / AI
  contributor path centered on a new "AI-Assisted Catalog
  Contribution" section (533 → ~270 lines after collapsing redundant
  test/lint sections). Attribution Standards moved to a new
  `docs/ATTRIBUTION.md` (parser docstring template, AI-attribution
  discipline, honest framing levels). Solo-maintained framing
  removed across all contributor-facing surfaces. Issue Closing
  Policy clarified: no auto-close ever; closing requires either an
  artifact (HAR + `modem.verified.json` for modem requests, reporter
  confirmation for bugs) or a deliberate manual close.
- **Issue-template polish.** `modem_verification.yml` and
  `modem_request.yml` issue templates trimmed to a single ask each;
  dropped "we" framing, the inline diagnostics-download walkthrough,
  and the trailing "What Happens Next?" sections. Also codified
  issue-label mutual-exclusivity (`needs-triage` / `in-development`
  / `needs-testing` / `needs-data` / `backlog` are exactly one) and
  the `release:vX.Y` rule in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **CHANGELOG hygiene** — internal roadmap references (Pxx codes,
  internal milestone names) stripped from prior alpha sections;
  user-facing entries cite GitHub issues only.
- **Linter config alignment.** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` ruff bumped
  from v0.8.2 to v0.15.2 to match the project venv; the two
  versions disagreed on import-block formatting and 15
  catalog_tools test files were ping-ponging on every `--fix`.
  Folded in two markdownlint fixes that had been generating noise:
  bare URL in `CONTRIBUTING.md` (MD034) wrapped in angle brackets,
  and the vendored CodeQL workspace clone directory added to
  markdownlint ignores. The new ruff `ruff` hook id is a legacy
  alias in v0.15.x — flagged for a follow-up cleanup, not blocking.

### Added

- **Recovery state machine** — new `orchestration/recovery.py` owns
  the post-disruption polling window as a single concept with three
  triggers: a dispatched restart command, an observed connectivity
  outage, and a 2-of-3 reboot-signal vote (counter reset, uptime
  drop, transitional DOCSIS state). HA's `recovery_adapter.py`
  subscribes to a Core observer callback and flips the data
  coordinator to a faster cadence while the window is open. Restart
  (`orchestration/restart.py`) is now a one-shot command — it
  dispatches the reboot, triggers recovery, and returns; it no
  longer probes or waits. Status sensors render snapshot truth
  throughout (no synthetic "Restarting…" label).
- **Canonical channel key order** — `models/field_registry.py`
  exposes `CHANNEL_FIELD_ORDER` and `canonicalize_channel_keys()`;
  the HA diagnostics builder routes `downstream_channels` and
  `upstream_channels` through it before emit. Output order is now
  predictable (identification → location → quality → errors)
  regardless of each modem's native table layout.
- **CM2050V confirmed** on firmware tested by #105 (Dragon1473) —
  catalog promoted from `awaiting_verification` to `confirmed`.
- **Auth-failure detail in the log** — when authentication fails,
  the collector now emits a single sanitized `WARNING` carrying the
  modem's response (strategy, request line, status, Content-Type,
  body snippet with the user's password redacted and URL query
  stripped). Targets the stuck-in-setup workflow in #86, #104, #120
  without the "please enable debug logging and retry" round-trip.
  Same line surfaces in initial setup, reauth, options-flow
  re-validation, and steady-state polling — no per-flow plumbing.
- **Channel-bond change notifications** — the integration raises a
  persistent notification when downstream or upstream bonded channel
  totals change between polls, with a hint pointing at the
  `generate_dashboard` dev service so a stale dashboard can be
  refreshed. First-poll onboarding notification surfaces the same
  service for new users. Suppressed during restart-recovery windows
  (transient flux is expected). Baseline totals persist via a
  dedicated `Store` helper — not config-entry data — so updates
  don't trigger integration reloads. Documented in
  `HA_ADAPTER_SPEC.md` including a new "Persistence Layers" section
  covering the runtime_data / entry.data / entry.options / Store
  split.

### Changed

- **Transport-failure logs name the exception class** — auth and
  resource-load failures now prefix the wrapped requests exception
  class (`ConnectionError:`, `ConnectTimeout:`, `SSLError:`,
  `RemoteDisconnected:`, …) before the upstream message. Lets log
  scans and AI-assisted triage tell a refusal from a handshake
  failure from a half-closed socket without parsing the inner tuple
  representation. Applies to the loader chain (HTTP/HNAP/CBN), every
  auth strategy, and the collector's `Auth failed` detail line.
- **Log levels: genuine failures emit at `WARNING`, not `INFO`** —
  the collector's resource-load and connection-failure paths and the
  policy module's connectivity-failure / load-error transitions were
  previously `INFO`, indistinguishable from per-poll progress. They
  now surface at `WARNING` so the noise floor reflects real
  problems.
- **Reset-entity log breaks down by platform** — the
  `Removing N entities for reset` line now appends a per-platform
  count (`3 button, 141 sensor`), so the number reconciles with each
  platform's own `Created N entities` line on re-init.
- **ModemHealth freshness gate** — the health probe exposes
  `latest_probe_at`; the orchestrator refuses to clear connectivity
  backoff based on a stale RESPONSIVE reading from before an
  observed outage.
- **HA operation mutex** — `coordinator.active_operation` now gates
  Restart and Reset Entities buttons against each other; the
  destructive-button discipline lives on `RuntimeData` rather than
  the button instances.
- **Adaptive health-check default interval** — at setup, modems with
  neither ICMP nor HTTP HEAD support default to a 60s health check
  (versus 30s when either lightweight probe is available). GET-only
  probes download a full page body, so slowing the cadence reduces
  load on budget modem web servers. v1→v2 migration also defaults
  to 60s since probe data collected during migration is not
  trustworthy.

### Removed

- **Per-modem behavior flags** — the `behaviors:` block is removed
  from every `modem.yaml`. Per-modem behavior tuning was a Core
  extension point that attracted misuse; recovery timing is generic
  (see `Recovery` class attributes) and no other behavior knob is
  needed across the fleet.
- **`BehaviorsConfig` / `RestartPhase` / `response_monitor` /
  `channel_stability` / `parsers/coordinator` legacy modules** —
  the old restart-monitor plumbing is replaced by the unified
  recovery module.
- **`HnapAuthDiagnostics`** — the HNAP-specific diagnostic dataclass
  and `HnapAuthManager.last_auth_diagnostics` property are removed.
  HNAP auth diagnostics now flow through the generic on-demand
  capture along with every other strategy, and with sanitized
  wire detail rather than raw request/response dicts.

## [3.14.0-alpha.16] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Dual-mode channel identity** — position mode (`channel_number`) is
  the default for new installs, giving stable entity IDs across
  reboots. Existing installs keep ID mode (`channel_id`) via v1→v2
  migration so DCID-based naming continues. A `convert_channel_identity`
  service renames recorder statistics to match the current mode after a
  remove-and-re-add in the other mode, so historical graphs survive the
  switch. Related to #117.
- **Channel numbering across all parser formats** — Core auto-assigns
  `channel_number` (1-based position) on all 7 parser formats. Unlocked
  channels now return only `channel_number` + `lock_status`; all other
  fields are nulled. Locked-only channels count toward the DS/US totals.
- **TCP vs HTTP timing separation in health probes** — HTTP probe now
  measures TCP connect and server response independently. TCP is
  logged for diagnostics; `http_latency_ms` carries only server
  response time (the modem load indicator). Related to #117.
- **SB8200 HW v7 variant** — unprefixed base64 credentials in the URL
  query string; same page/parser as base SB8200, only auth parameters
  differ. MCP intake pipeline detects the unprefixed form. Related
  to #124.
- **Request-side query param detection in MCP intake** — session-level
  query parameters that appear on every data-fetch entry are emitted
  as `session.query_params` in the analysis output (filters jQuery
  cache-busters and auth-managed params). Related to #86.

### Fixed

- **Dashboard restart confirmation dialog** — the restart button moved
  out of the entities-card row into a dedicated button card so the
  confirmation dialog reliably fires on every tap (the entities-card
  row `tap_action` was being bypassed by the inner button widget).
- **MB8611 / MB8600 restart** — added `pre_fetch_action` mirroring
  the Arris HNAP pattern (browser always calls `GetMotoStatusSecXXX`
  before `SetStatusSecuritySettings`). Without the pre-fetch the
  modem returns ERROR instead of accepting the SET. Related to #60.
- **TG3442DE data-fetch and logout** — firmware requires a `_n=`
  cache-buster query parameter on all AJAX requests; server returns
  HTTP 400 without it. `session.query_params` now threads static
  query parameters through both the HTTP resource loader and the
  action executor. Related to #86.
- **`form_pbkdf2` auth Content-Type** — Technicolor modems only accept
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, not JSON. The salt request and
  login POST now send form-encoded bodies. Resolves "No salt in
  server response" failures. Related to #120, #115.
- **Config flow connectivity error propagation** — the `form_nonce`
  encoding pre-fetch swallowed all exceptions and fell back to plain
  encoding, then proceeded to a doomed auth attempt. Connectivity
  and timeout errors now surface immediately as "network unreachable"
  instead of 40-line DEBUG tracebacks. Also fixes the
  `verified`/`confirmed` status check so confirmed modems no longer
  render with the unverified marker.
- **Grace-period stability log** — probes firing during the
  post-stability grace window now log `(grace: 12s/30s)` instead of
  the misleading `(stable: 4/3)` counter that overflowed past the
  threshold.

### Changed

- **Function/type colocation sweep** — free functions that take a
  single typed argument moved onto the type (e.g. `find_mapping` →
  `FieldMapping.find_by`, `detect_transport` → `TransportResult.detect`,
  `detect_auth` → `AuthDetail.detect`). Phase-local MCP result types
  moved out of the shared registry into their phase module.
  `get_device_name` moved out of HA `const.py` into `lib/utils.py` to
  keep `const.py` a pure leaf.
- **Config flow variant labels** — variants with the same auth
  strategy are now disambiguated by variant name instead of ISP list:
  `"URL Token (Comcast, Spectrum)"` → `"URL Token"` (default),
  `"URL Token (Spectrum)"` → `"URL Token — v7"` (named).
- **Fleet verification** — TM1602A confirmed on alpha.15 user
  diagnostics (#112); CH7465MT confirmed post provisioned-speed fix;
  SB6190 form-nonce with b64_packed encoding confirmed (#83);
  Broadcom BCM3390 chipset identified on CGA6444VF and CGA4236.

## [3.14.0-alpha.15] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- **Form-nonce base64 credential encoding** — auto-detect firmware that
  packs credentials as base64 into a hidden form field (SB6190 9.1.x).
  Encoding type discovered at setup time and stored in config entry.
  Related to #83, #93.
- **JS endpoint discovery in MCP intake** — scan HAR JavaScript content
  (standalone `.js` files + inline `<script>` blocks) for AJAX/fetch
  targets and diff against captured URLs. Uncaptured endpoints surface
  as advisory warnings during `analyze_har()`. Related to #86.
- **AST sandbox validator for parser.py** — enforces pure-parser
  principle via static analysis at `run_tests` and `write_modem_package`
  gates. Only safe stdlib + bs4/typing allowed; forbidden builtins
  (`eval`/`exec`/`open`) and relative imports rejected.

### Fixed

- **S33v2 confirmed** — verified on real hardware via alpha.14
  diagnostics. Rebuilt all `modem.verified.json` files from original
  GitHub diagnostics to preserve full modem data verbatim. Related
  to #117.
- **CGA2121 missing form field** — added `hidden_fields.language_selector`
  to CGA2121 modem.yaml (browser sends it during login but it was
  missing from config). Related to #96.
- **Provisioned speed direction swap** — DOCSIS service flow direction
  was reversed in CH7465MT (direction 1=downstream, 2=upstream per
  MULPI spec). Provisioned speed fields now store raw bps at Core
  level; HA sensor layer declares `DATA_RATE` device class for
  automatic Mbit/s display. Related to #129.
- **SJCL session validation empty body** — session finalization POST
  used `post_json()` which requires a JSON dict, but TG3442DE returns
  HTTP 200 with empty body (valid success). Replaced with plain POST.
  Related to #86.
- **DM1000 response encoding mismatch** — mock server now decodes
  HAR `content.encoding: base64` per HAR 1.2 spec. Without this,
  modems whose HAR uses base64 storage were served raw base64 text.
  Related to #92.
- **Log message quality — soak findings** — session label
  "none" → "new" on first poll; collector drops error text from
  connectivity logs; HA adapter logs poll-failure alongside
  coordinator success; coordinator name includes model + IP.

### Changed

- **Single-source system_info** — `modem_data` diagnostics summary
  reduced to evaluated connection + health state (6 fields);
  `system_info` is now the single source for all modem metadata.
  `docsis_status` enriched into `system_info` (not derived in
  parallel). Related to #117.
- **Self-describing auth strategies + Core orchestrator factory** —
  auth models carry `display_name` and `transport` ClassVars on
  shared `AuthStrategyBase`. Component assembly moved from HA adapter
  to Core factory (`create_collector`, `create_orchestrator`).
  Adding a new auth strategy is three additive files, zero
  modifications to existing code.
- **Parser sandbox rules and contribution docs** — PARSING_SPEC,
  ONBOARDING_SPEC, SYSTEM_INFO_SPEC, MODEM_DIRECTORY_SPEC updated
  with sandbox constraints, sanitization checks, and docsis_status
  pass-through semantics.

## [3.14.0-alpha.14] - 2026-04-09

### Added

- **SB6183 catalog entry** — Arris SB6183 no-auth modem with transposed
  table parsing. Related to #95.
- **Hub 5 catalog entry** — Virgin Media SuperHub 5 (VMDG660) with
  REST API JSON parsing, no auth required. Related to #82.
- **CODA56 re-intake** — Hitron CODA56 rebuilt with JSON body sniffing,
  `system_info` array_path support, and spec split. Related to #89.
- **Uptime normalization** — `scale` support on all system_info formats
  (seconds, duration strings, tick counts) across the fleet.
- **Provisioned speed sensors** — `child_aggregates` for downstream/
  upstream provisioned speed, `scale` on `system_info`, fleet-wide
  rollout.
- **YAML-driven `docsis_status` normalization** — StrEnum pass-through
  with configurable value mapping in parser YAML.

### Fixed

- **TG3442DE SJCL login** — missing `csrfNonce` header and wrong
  plaintext format broke authentication. Related to #86.
- **SB6190 `form_nonce` auth** — response reuse bug where auth manager
  consumed the response body twice; config completeness fixes.
  Related to #83, #93.
- **TM1602A parser enrichment** — added `docsis_status`, upstream
  modulation, and metadata cleanup. Related to #112.
- **CM1200 field mappings** — added missing field mappings and
  verification artifact. Related to #121.
- **Fleet-wide aggregate sweep** — `lock_status` filter corrections
  and firmware quirk documentation across catalog.

### Changed

- **DM1000 HAR expanded** — full JSON data endpoints captured.
- **Auth strategy specs extracted** — SJCL, PBKDF2, and CBN auth
  strategies documented in dedicated spec files.
- **Pre-commit hook** — new hook to catch gitignored path references.
- **Pre-commit config** — consolidated duplicate `pre-commit-hooks`
  repo blocks.

## [3.14.0-alpha.13] - 2026-04-08

### Added

- **CM1100 catalog entry** — Netgear CM1100 with form auth hidden
  field discovery. Related to #104.
- **DM1000 enhancements** — `password_field` list, per-array JSON
  resources, OFDM channel support. Related to #92.
- **MCP form discovery** — `login_page` emission, discoverable
  `hidden_fields` filtering, `form_selector` detection.
- **SJCL known-answer tests** — fixture-driven crypto tests anchored
  to `sjclCrypto.js` reference values, plus end-to-end integration
  test running `FormSjclAuthManager` against `HARMockServer`.

### Fixed

- **SJCL PBKDF2 salt encoding** — `_derive_key()` was UTF-8 encoding
  the salt instead of hex-decoding it, producing a different AES key
  than the modem expects. The bug was invisible in tests because the
  mock server had the same encoding error. Related to #86.
- **Deferred entity initial state** — guarantee initial state for
  deferred entities (UC-84).
- **Diagnostics error totals** — use Core canonical names in HA
  diagnostics.
- **Backoff off-by-one** — immediate circuit trip on credential
  rejection.
- **Stale probe flags** — drop stale `supports_icmp`/`supports_head`
  flags from v1→v2 config entry migration. Related to PR #57.

### Changed

- **MB8600 confirmed** — from user diagnostics. Related to #40.
- **CM820B confirmed** — from alpha.12 diagnostics. Related to PR #57.
- **MCP accuracy tracking** — replaced regression diff counts with
  field-level accuracy tracking.
- **Spec encoding boundaries** — ARCHITECTURE.md and MODEM_YAML_SPEC.md
  now explicitly document hex-decode/UTF-8 encoding at each step of
  the SJCL crypto chain.

## [3.14.0-alpha.12] - 2026-04-06

### Added

- **`javascript_json` format detection** — MCP intake pipeline now
  detects JS variable assignments containing JSON arrays in
  `<script>` tags (e.g., TG3442DE `json_dsData = [{...}]`).
- **Native `docsis_status`** — MB7621 (`Network Access`
  from MotoConnection.asp) and XB6/XB7 (`combined_status` computed
  from downstream + upstream status). Three modems now have native
  DOCSIS status instead of relying on lock-status derivation.
- **form_sjcl MCP detection** — intake pipeline recognizes SJCL
  AES-CCM login flows (encrypted POST body, JS page variables
  `myIv`/`mySalt`/`currentSessionId`). Related to #86.
- **Diagnostics enrichment** — `ResourceFetch` captures `status_code`
  and `content_type`. `OrchestratorDiagnostics` includes
  `auth_strategy`. Per-resource timing in HTTP/HNAP/CBN loaders.
- **`docs/README.md`** — project-level documentation index.

### Changed

- **HAR files moved to Git LFS** — 36 HAR test fixtures (~7.7 MB)
  stored as LFS pointers. New `load_har_json()` utility detects LFS
  pointers and auto-recovers. Contributors need `git-lfs` installed.
- **Shared auth JSON response helper** — extracted `auth/response.py`
  from form_sjcl, form_pbkdf2, and hnap. Consistent error messages
  with diagnostics logging, double-decode, and type checking.
  form_pbkdf2 login response now gets a proper type check.
- **Docs restructured** — `INTAKE_PIPELINE.md` and `MOCK_SERVER.md`
  moved to Catalog docs (closer to the code they document). Broken
  links fixed across reference docs.
- **`zip_release` reverted** — `hacs.json` reverted to
  `zip_release: false` for alpha branch-tracking installs.

### Fixed

- **MCP intake pipeline regressions** — session cookie detection
  expanded (`credential`/`sec` indicators), strategy-aware auth field
  copy, `html_fields` CSS selector serialization, nested JSON
  direction inference (G54 recursive key scanning).
- **Internal quality improvements** — `to_dict()` on diagnostics models,
  mock server `get_challenge_response()`, generic `ComputedField`
  for derived system_info, CM1200 InitTagValue offset docs.
- **Computed `system_info` fields** — generic `ComputedField` with
  named operations (e.g., CGA4236 `memory_used_pct`).

## [3.14.0-alpha.11] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- **Form auth false-positive on server errors** — `_check_success`
  fallback accepted any non-401 response as auth success when no
  explicit criteria were configured (13 modems). Now rejects all
  HTTP status >= 400. Also fixed three `requests.Response` truthiness
  checks that masked error status codes as 0 in logs.
- **DOCSIS 3.1 aggregate scoping** — 6 DOCSIS 3.1 modems (S33, S33v2,
  S33v3, S34, MB8600, MB8611) mixed QAM FEC and OFDM LDPC codewords
  in `total_corrected`/`total_uncorrected`. Scoped to QAM-only
  (`downstream.qam`) so totals carry the same semantic across the
  fleet. Removed SB8200v3 aggregate (no QAM error counters).
- **DOCSIS status field normalized** — 9 modems using inconsistent
  field names (`network_access`, `cm_status`, `registration_status`)
  normalized to canonical `docsis_status`.
- **CM1100 HAR** — added missing redirect target exposed by auth fix.
- **Health skip logging** — distinguished "collection active" from
  "recent collection" in skip messages.

### Added

- **HACS zip release asset** — HACS now downloads a 124 KB zip of only
  the integration files instead of the full 3.4 MB source archive.
  Added `loggers` field to `manifest.json` for debug logging.
- **Fleet-augmented MCP intake** — Catalog extension point scans 35
  parser.yaml files for 7 pattern categories (selectors, labels, IDs,
  JSON keys, delimiters, channel types, aggregates) and feeds them
  back into Core analysis and config generation.
- **Arris SB6141** — upgraded from synthetic to real-hardware catalog
  entry with system_info, codeword aggregates, and restart action.
- **MCP generator DOCSIS-version-aware** — auto-generates
  `downstream.qam` scope for DOCSIS 3.1, `downstream` for 3.0.

### Improved

- **Documentation restructure** — consolidated 6 overlapping setup
  docs into hub-and-spoke tree. Fixed 459 markdownlint violations.
  Reduced total doc lines by 26%.
- **Issue templates** — rewritten for HAR-only workflow with incognito
  capture warning. Removed stale Fallback Mode references from specs.

### Reverted

- **`zip_release` in hacs.json** — broke branch-based installs for
  alpha testers. HACS expects a zip asset on a GitHub release, but
  branch refs have no release. Reverted to source archive download.
  Will re-enable at stable release.

## [3.14.0-alpha.10] - 2026-04-04

### Added

- **Netgear CM3000** — New catalog entry for DOCSIS 3.1 modem with
  form auth (XSRF_TOKEN cookie). Same tagValueList format as
  CM2000/CM2050V. (Related to #127)
- **Core analysis module** — New `analysis` package with log parsing,
  diagnostics bridging, and outage duration computation. Split from
  monolithic script into Core (platform-agnostic models + parser) and
  HA layer (adapter-specific patterns + report formatting).
- **Arris S33v3 system_info enrichment** — Added system uptime and
  hardware version to S33v3 parser via `GetCustomerStatusSoftware`
  SOAP action, sourced from jzucker2 HAR capture. (Related to #98)

### Improved

- **Health check HTTP probe suppression** — HTTP health probe is now
  skipped when a data collection is active (avoids web server
  contention) or recently succeeded (redundant — collection already
  proved HTTP reachability). ICMP still runs. Eliminates ~550ms
  latency blips observed when health checks and data polls fire
  simultaneously after HA reload.

### Fixed

- **JS line comment stripping** — JS parser now strips `//` line
  comments before tagValueList extraction. Previously matched
  commented-out example data instead of live values, causing wrong
  DOCSIS status and missing uptime on CM1200. (Related to #121)
- **CM820B error totals and DOCSIS status** — Added aggregate section
  to CM820B parser.yaml for error totals. Added fallback in
  `derive_docsis_status()` to check `system_info.docsis_status` when
  per-channel `lock_status` is absent (2011-era hardware).
  (Related to #57)
- **S33/S33v2 uptime note** — Corrected modem.yaml notes that claimed
  "System uptime not available." HAR evidence confirms the HNAP API
  returns real uptime in `CustomerConnSystemUpTime`; the modem's
  JavaScript swaps the display to show clock time (browser UI bug).
- **Non-dict JSON response guards** — Added `isinstance(data, dict)`
  guards at all 8 `resp.json()` call sites across auth managers,
  HNAP loader, and HNAP action executor. Fixes crash when modems
  return double-encoded JSON strings. (Related to #86)
- **Restart button availability** — Button entity now tracks
  in-progress state dynamically instead of staying disabled after
  a restart completes.

## [3.14.0-alpha.9] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- **CBN transport** — New transport for Compal-based modems using
  encrypted XML APIs with PBKDF2/AES-CBC auth. (Related to #129)
- **Compal CH7465MT** — New catalog entry for Vodafone Station
  (Ziggo NL). CBN transport, DOCSIS 3.0. (Related to #129)
- **Arris S33v3** — New catalog entry. Uses SHA256 HMAC (not MD5 like
  S33/S33v2), compatible with S34 parser. (Related to #98)
- **Arris SB8200v3** — New catalog entry using CBN transport with
  XML multi-resource sections for DOCSIS 3.1 QAM+OFDM channels.
  (Related to #109)
- **XML `tables[]` for multi-resource sections** — XML parser now
  supports multiple table definitions per section (matching HTML/JSON
  pattern), enabling DOCSIS 3.1 modems with separate QAM/OFDM API
  endpoints.
- **`javascript_vars` system_info format** — New Core format handler
  for extracting system_info from simple JS variable assignments
  (`var x = 'value'`). Used by TG3442DE and future Arris Touchstone
  modems.
- **TG3442DE: `cm_status` and `connected_devices`** — New system_info
  fields from `overview_data.php`. DOCSIS online/offline status and
  connected device count. Test data rebuilt from contributor HAR
  capture. (Related to #86)

### Fixed

- **Migration manufacturer normalization** — v1 manufacturer strings
  (e.g., "Arris/CommScope") now normalize to catalog values ("Arris")
  during migration, fixing options flow lookup failures.
- **Migration variant resolution** — v1 `auth_strategy` field now
  correctly maps to v2 variant (e.g., `form_nonce` → SB6190
  `form-nonce` variant). (Related to #121)
- **`software_version` field name** — All Arris HNAP parser configs
  corrected from `firmware_version` to the canonical `software_version`
  field name.

### Changed

- **S33v2 and MB8600 split into standalone catalog entries** — Each
  model now has its own directory, parser, and golden file instead of
  being aliases.
- **Contributor attribution uses full GitHub profile URLs** across the
  entire catalog.

## [3.14.0-alpha.8] - 2026-04-02

### Added

- **Dynamic system_info sensors** — HA now creates sensors
  dynamically from parser-reported system_info fields (software
  version, hardware version, uptime, etc.) instead of a fixed set.
- **Health auto-recovery** — Connectivity backoff counter auto-clears
  when health probes detect recovery, reducing unnecessary wait time
  after transient network issues.
- **Pyright pre-commit hook** — Catches Pylance-visible type errors
  that mypy misses (`object` vs `Any`, submodule access).
- **MCP pipeline regression test** — Wired into the CI
  `test-packages` job for continuous validation.
- **CSS class selector** — `html_fields` format now supports CSS class
  selectors for field extraction, in addition to label/id selectors.

### Fixed

- **Config flow HTTPS retry** — Auth signal is now preserved when the
  HTTPS retry path fails, preventing silent loss of auth error context.
- **Sensor latency flicker** — Latency values are cached to prevent
  display flicker when a health probe fails intermittently.
- **Catalog→Core dependency pin** — Exact-pinned for uv pre-release
  compatibility.
- **Config flow test coverage** — Fixed test gaps and PII hook
  placement.
- **Log levels and namespaces** — Polished startup milestones, debug
  vs info boundaries, and namespace consistency across Core and HA.

### Changed

- **Fleet YAML key ordering normalized** across all catalog entries.
- **Golden file normalization** — Consistent formatting across all
  modem expected output files.
- **Scripts directory audit** — Removed dead files, fixed stale doc
  references.
- **Spec consistency audit** — Fixed links, terminology, and gaps
  across architecture and orchestration specs.

## [3.14.0-alpha.7] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **HNAP stale session recovery** — Reused HNAP sessions that return
  HTTP errors now trigger re-authentication on the next poll cycle.
  v3.14 uses signal-based recovery (`HNAPLoadError` → `LOAD_AUTH`)
  instead of v3.13's within-poll zero-channel heuristic. (Related
  to #117)
- **url_token body token extraction** — `UrlTokenAuthManager` now
  extracts the session token from the login response body (not just
  cookies). On some SB8200 firmware the body token differs from the
  cookie value. Uses `success_indicator` as a response type
  discriminator: body contains indicator → data page (no token);
  body is short string → token; empty body → cookie fallback.
  (Related to #81)
- **Pre-login cookie clearing** — `UrlTokenAuthManager` clears the
  stale session cookie before sending the login request. Modems that
  reject re-login when an existing session cookie is present (SB8200)
  no longer fail on session re-establishment.
- **Form auth Referer header** — `FormAuthManager` now sends
  `Referer: {base_url}` on login POST requests. Defensive measure
  restored from v3.13 for firmware that validates the Referer header.
- **HNAP header parsing warnings** — Added urllib3 warning filter for
  HNAP modems that send malformed HTTP headers with debug timing data
  prepended (S34 firmware quirk). Suppresses noisy "Failed to parse
  headers" warnings in HA logs on every poll cycle.
- **Auth log_level parameter** — All 8 auth managers now accept a
  `log_level` parameter, consistent with the existing action executor
  pattern. Config flow auth logs at INFO for visibility; polling auth
  logs at DEBUG to keep steady-state logs clean.

### Added

- **HNAP auth diagnostics** — `HnapAuthDiagnostics` dataclass captures
  challenge and login request/response pairs (passwords redacted) for
  field debugging. Accessible via `HnapAuthManager.last_auth_diagnostics`.

### Changed

- **cookie_name ownership** — `cookie_name` moved from `SessionConfig`
  to individual auth strategy configs (`FormAuth`, `BasicAuth`,
  `UrlTokenAuth`, etc.). `token_prefix` moved to `UrlTokenAuth`.
  `SessionConfig` is now lifecycle-only (`max_concurrent`, `headers`).
  This restores the v3.13 boundary where auth owns the cookie it
  produces. 14 modem.yaml files, collector, test harness, and MCP
  config generator updated. 7 spec files updated.

## [3.14.0-alpha.6] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed

- **HNAP PrivateKey cookie** — HNAP data requests now include the
  `PrivateKey` cookie alongside `uid`, matching the Login.js protocol.
  Some firmware returns HTTP 500 without it. Regression from v3.13
  where the cookie was set but never documented in specs — v3.14's
  clean-room implementation missed it. (Related to #117)

### Changed

- HNAP session documented as `uid` + `PrivateKey` cookies across all
  specs (MODEM_YAML_SPEC, ORCHESTRATION_SPEC, RUNTIME_POLLING_SPEC,
  ONBOARDING_SPEC, ARCHITECTURE).

## [3.14.0-alpha.5] - 2026-03-31

### Fixed

- Config flow retries with HTTPS when authentication fails on
  auto-detected HTTP — fixes modems that redirect during auth
  but not during initial probe.
- Sensor entity properties (unit, icon, state class) invalidated
  on coordinator updates, fixing stale values after data changes.
- Removed dead code in 5 catalog parsers (TG3442DE, CODA56,
  DM1000, XB6, XB7).

### Changed

- HA adapter test coverage: 70% → 91% (304 tests). New coverage
  for startup sequence, diagnostics builder, async migration,
  dashboard YAML generation, and service registration.
- Test fixtures standardized on generic names (Solent Labs /
  TPS-2000) with mock boundary at Core/Catalog I/O layer.
- Consolidated pytest.ini into pyproject.toml.

## [3.14.0-alpha.4] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Data-dependent sensor entities (channels, system metrics, LAN stats) are
  now created via deferred one-shot listener when the first poll fails due
  to modem being unreachable at HA startup. Previously these entities were
  never created, leaving the integration permanently incomplete until HA
  restarted with the modem online.
- Misleading "session: expired" and "Session invalid" log messages for
  logout modems (e.g., MB7621) now read "session: none" and "No active
  session" — the session was intentionally cleared by logout, not expired.

### Documentation

- Added UC-84 (startup while modem unreachable) to orchestration use cases
- Added "Deferred Entity Creation" section to HA Adapter Spec
- Fixed incorrect `ConfigEntryNotReady` claim in HA Adapter Spec — the
  orchestrator never raises, so first refresh always succeeds
- Added "Modem unreachable at startup" row to Entity Model availability table

## [3.14.0-alpha.3] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- Catalog package dependency on Core now allows pre-release versions
  (`>=3.14.0a1`). Fixes `uv`/`pip` resolver failure on fresh HA installs
  where no stable Core release exists on PyPI.

## [3.14.0-alpha.2] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- 75 HA adapter tests (config flow, options flow, services, diagnostics,
  migrations, sensors, buttons) — coverage 28% → 70%
- PyPI publishing workflow (`publish.yml`) with trusted publishers
- Alpha versioning support in CI — feature branch pushes trigger PyPI
  alpha releases, GitHub release workflow skips alpha tags
- Package README updates with PyPI badges and installation instructions

### Fixed

- CI validation failures from version consistency and package build checks
- HA dev container startup reliability (correct pip install paths)
- Release workflow: skip GitHub release creation for alpha tags

## [3.14.0-alpha.1] - 2026-03-30

### Architecture

v3.14 is a full architecture rewrite. The monolithic `custom_components/`
codebase is split into three layered packages:

- **`cable_modem_monitor_core`** — Platform-agnostic library: config models,
  auth managers, parsers, orchestration, health monitoring, and MCP tools.
  Zero Home Assistant dependencies. 1,572 tests, 96% coverage.
- **`cable_modem_monitor_catalog`** — Data-driven modem catalog: YAML configs,
  parser configs, HAR fixtures, and golden files. Drop a directory to add a
  modem — no code changes required. 31 HAR replay regression tests.
- **`custom_components/cable_modem_monitor`** — Thin HA adapter: maps Core
  output to HA entities, coordinators, config flow, and diagnostics.

### Added

- **MCP Onboarding Pipeline** — Six-phase analysis pipeline that generates
  `modem.yaml` and `parser.yaml` from a HAR capture: `validate_har`,
  `analyze_har`, `generate_config`, `generate_parser`, `enrich_metadata`,
  and `golden_file` tools. Detects auth strategy, data format, channel
  mappings, and actions directly from HTTP evidence.
- **31 Modems in Catalog** — All v3.13 modems migrated plus 12 new: TM1602A,
  CODA56, CM1100, CM2050V, DM1000, CGA4236, CGA6444VF, TG3442DE, S33v2,
  MB8600, XB6, CGM4140COM. Includes 6 variant entries (S33v2, CM1200-HTTPS,
  TC4400AM, MB8600/MB8611 shared parser, XB6, CGM4140COM).
- **SJCL AES-CCM Auth Strategy** (`form_sjcl`) — New auth strategy for
  Arris TG3442DE modems that use Stanford JavaScript Crypto Library
  encryption (AES-CCM mode with PBKDF2 key derivation).
- **Transport-Scoped Action Executors** — HTTP and HNAP action execution
  split into protocol-specific modules with pre-fetch support, endpoint
  extraction, and HMAC-signed SOAP calls.
- **Health Pipeline** — Independent health monitoring with ICMP ping and
  HTTP probes running on a faster cadence than data polling. Configurable
  suppression windows, per-modem probe selection, and graceful timeout
  handling.
- **Orchestrator** — Central polling coordinator: session reuse across
  polls (HNAP uid + private key, cookie-based sessions), circuit breaker
  for auth failures, restart-window awareness, evidence-based error
  tracking with structured totals per category.
- **Restart Monitor** — Detects modem restarts via connectivity loss +
  recovery pattern, with configurable detection window and cooldown.
- **HAR Replay Test Harness** — Deterministic parser testing: mock HTTP
  server replays HAR responses, golden file comparison validates output.
  Auto-discovers testable modems from the catalog.
- **Circular Log Buffer** — Diagnostics log buffer with configurable
  capacity, compatible with HA 2025.11+ reload behavior.
- **Credential Param Classification** — MCP action detection now identifies
  credential fields by name and sanitizer patterns, replacing values with
  empty strings in generated configs.

### Changed

- **Modem configs are YAML-driven** — Auth strategy, session management,
  data pages, parser format, field mappings, actions, and metadata are all
  declared in `modem.yaml` and `parser.yaml`. No modem requires code changes.
- **Parser architecture** — Format-specific parsers (HTML table, transposed
  table, JS embedded, JSON, HNAP) with shared type conversion, field
  registry, and table selection. Column/field mappings declared in
  `parser.yaml`.
- **Auth architecture** — Strategy pattern with 8 implementations (none,
  basic, form, form_nonce, form_pbkdf2, form_sjcl, url_token, hnap).
  Each reads config from `modem.yaml` — no strategy requires modem-specific
  code.
- **HA adapter is thin** — Config flow, entity creation, coordinator
  wiring, diagnostics. No parsing, no auth, no modem-specific logic.
  Uses `runtime_data` (HA 2024.12+) instead of `hass.data`.
- **v3.13 modules retired** — All v3.13 core modules, parsers, tests, and
  scripts removed. Clean break — no compatibility shims.

### Fixed

- **MB7621 restart** — Restart POST now includes all 6 required form fields
  (HAR-driven, not fixture-inspected). Previous config silently failed.
- **DOCSIS version false positive** — `enrich_metadata` now checks actual
  `channel_type` map values for OFDM/OFDMA, not just field presence. A
  DOCSIS 3.0 modem with a `channel_type` column no longer triggers 3.1.
- **Auth encoding detection** — Falls back to login page JavaScript analysis
  (`keyStr` constant, `btoa()`) when POST body value is sanitized.
- **Table footer detection** — MCP analysis and runtime parser now reject
  summary/footer rows ("Total", "Sum", etc.).
- **Sparse row filtering** — Runtime parser skips rows where fewer than half
  the declared columns produced values.

## [3.13.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **HNAP Session Reuse** - Reuse existing HNAP sessions (uid cookie + private key) across poll cycles instead of re-authenticating every 60 seconds. Prevents anti-brute-force reboots on Arris S33/S33v2 modems (~1440 logins/day reduced to 1). Includes stale session detection with automatic retry on expired sessions. (#117)
- **S33v2 Model Aliases** - Added S33v2, CommScope S33v2, and ARRIS S33v2 to S33 detection aliases for hardware revision compatibility. (#117)
- **CM1200 Challenge Cookie Support** - Basic Auth now forwards the challenge cookie required by CM1200 HTTPS endpoints. (#121)
- **Protocol Auto-Detection** - Protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) is now decomposed from the host at config entry time, enabling correct scheme selection for modems like the CM1200 that use HTTPS. (#121)

### Fixed

- **Modem-specific timeout not applied** - All `_fetch_data` HTTP requests now use the modem's configured `timeout` instead of the hardcoded 10-second default. This fixes CM1200 read timeouts over HTTPS. (#121)
- **CM1200 request timeout** - Increased default timeout from 10s to 20s for CM1200 modems, which respond slowly over HTTPS. (#121)
- **HNAP login lockout detection** - HNAP auth now detects firmware-level login lockout responses (`LOCKUP`/`REBOOT`) and stops retrying to prevent modem reboot. (#117)
- **SB8200 url_token auth** - `ajax_login` and `auth_header_data` config values are now correctly propagated to the url_token auth strategy. (#126)
- **S33/S34 invalid URL** - Removed nonexistent lowercase `cmconnectionstatus.html` fallback URL from S33 and S34 modem configs.
- **CM1200 auth type corrected** - Changed CM1200 auth type from `basic` to `none` to match actual modem behavior. (#121)

## [3.13.1] - 2026-02-27

### Fixed

- **CM1200 zero channel data regression** - Fixed redundant authentication call that caused basic_http modems (CM1200, C7000v2, CM600, C3700, TC4400) to make an extra HTTP request per poll cycle. The `_pre_authenticate()` gate condition incorrectly used HTML presence as a proxy for "auth was performed," but basic_http auth is stateless and never returns HTML. This caused connection resets on modems that rate-limit rapid HTTPS requests. (#121)

## [3.13.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- **Arris/CommScope S34 Support** - HNAP protocol with HMAC-SHA256 authentication. 32 downstream + 5 upstream SC-QAM channels, plus OFDM/OFDMA. (Thanks [@rplancha](https://github.com/rplancha)! Based on [PR #90](https://github.com/solentlabs/cable_modem_monitor/pull/90))
- **ARRIS CM3500B Support** - EuroDOCSIS 3.1 cable modem with form-based authentication. Parses 24+ SC-QAM downstream, 2 OFDM downstream, 4 ATDMA upstream, and 1 OFDMA upstream channels. (Thanks [@ChBi89](https://github.com/ChBi89)! #73)
- **SB6190 Auth Support (9.1.103+)** - Added `form_nonce` auth strategy for ARRIS SB6190 modems with newer firmware that require login. Uses plain form POST with client-generated nonce instead of base64-encoded credentials. (#93, #83)
- **Entity Prefix Selection** - Multi-modem setups can now configure custom entity prefixes during setup to avoid naming conflicts
- **HTTP HEAD Auto-Detection** - Health monitor now auto-detects whether the modem supports HTTP HEAD requests during setup. Modems that don't support HEAD (e.g., TC4400's `micro_httpd`) use GET-only, eliminating session poisoning that caused permanent health check failures. (#94)
- **Configurable HMAC Algorithm** - `HNAPJsonRequestBuilder` now supports `hmac_algorithm` parameter ("md5" or "sha256") for modems with different authentication requirements
- **Action Layer Architecture** - Restart functionality now uses data-driven action definitions in `modem.yaml` instead of hardcoded parser methods
- **Circular Log Buffer** - New diagnostics buffer compatible with HA 2025.11+ that preserves logs across integration reloads
- **Diagnostic Logging Enhancement** - Added ERROR-level logging when parser receives login page HTML instead of data, making session expiration issues easier to diagnose during troubleshooting

### Changed

- **Modular Init** - `__init__.py` monolith extracted into focused modules (`setup.py`, `lifecycle.py`, `data_update.py`) (#1)
- **DataOrchestrator** - `ModemScraper` renamed to `DataOrchestrator` for clarity (#14)
- **Parser Registry** - `parser_discovery` module renamed to `parser_registry`
- **Fallback Subsystem** - Unknown modem discovery moved to `core/fallback/` directory
- **Auth Config Consolidation** - All auth configuration now lives in `auth.types{}` section of `modem.yaml`
- **Metadata Consolidation** - Separate `metadata.yaml` files merged into `modem.yaml`
- **Protocol Detection** - Removed hardcoded `default_port` and `protocol` from `modem.yaml`; now auto-detected
- **CGA2121 Data Page Config** - Parser now reads primary data page path from `modem.yaml` `pages.data` config instead of hardcoding, reducing duplication between parser and modem config

### Fixed

- **SB8200 HTTPS Session** - Match real browser behavior observed in HAR captures: login requests now include `X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest` header, data requests omit `Authorization` header. Session cookie cleared before login to prevent stale cookie conflicts. (#81)
- **SB6190 Parser Error** - Fixed parser returning 0 channels in production despite successful authentication. Parser now prioritizes explicit path (`/cgi-bin/status`) over root path (`/`) to avoid receiving auth response HTML instead of status page data. (#93, #83)
- **SB6190 Form AJAX Auth** - Fixed "invalid_credentials" error when using form_ajax authentication (firmware 9.1.103+). The config flow helper was not passing the form_ajax configuration to the auth workflow. (#93, #83)
- **XB7 Parser Data Page Path** - Fixed parser error when XB7 modem.yaml specifies a data page path. Parser now correctly reads from the configured path. (#107)
- **C7000v2 Session Management** - Fixed browser lockout and session issues by correcting session cookie name (`XSRF_TOKEN` instead of `session`) and logout endpoint (`/goform/logout` instead of `/Logout.htm`). Added POST support for `/goform/` logout endpoints. (#61)
- **TC4400 Parser Error** - Fixed parser returning 0 channels in v3.13.0 betas despite successful authentication. Parser now prioritizes explicit path (`/cmconnectionstatus.html`) over root path (`/`) to avoid receiving auth response HTML instead of channel data. (#94)
- **CGA2121 Auth Redirect** - Fixed parser receiving wrong page when modem redirects to `/basicUX.html` after login instead of the data page `/st_docsis.html`. Parser now tries the specific data page path first, then falls back to "/" for legacy compatibility. (#75)
- **CM3500B Auth Config** - Removed incorrect `success_indicator` from CM3500B modem.yaml auth config that could interfere with authentication validation. (#73)
- **Form Auth HTML Response** - Fixed form authentication discarding the HTML response when auth succeeded without a `success_indicator`, causing parsers like CGA2121 to see empty data (#75)
- **Config Flow Auth Type Preservation** - Fixed "Reset Entities" losing user's auth type selection for modems with multiple auth variants (SB6190, SB8200). Options flow now preserves `CONF_AUTH_TYPE` from config entry, preventing fallback to default auth type after entity reset. (#93)
- **Diagnostics PII Sanitization** - Updated to har-capture 0.3.3 with `redact_flagged=True` for automatic redaction of WiFi credentials and device names, plus fixes for IPv4 address corruption (5-octet bug) and version string preservation.
- **Case-Insensitive Password Detection** - Password field detection now case-insensitive (#75)
- **G54 OFDM Channel IDs** - Handle OFDM/OFDMA prefixed channel IDs correctly
- **URL Pattern Ordering** - Protected pages now prioritized in URL pattern ordering for polling
- **Log Buffer Persistence** - Diagnostics log buffer preserved across integration reloads
- **HTTP/HTTPS Detection** - Try HTTP before HTTPS to prevent protocol mismatch on setup
- **HTTP HEAD SSL Blocking I/O** - Moved `ssl.create_default_context()` in HTTP HEAD auto-detection to executor to avoid blocking the HA event loop during config flow

### Improved

- **Exception Handling** - Replaced broad `except Exception` blocks with specific exception types for better diagnostics (#6)
- **Test Coverage** - Config flow tests now use proper HA test infrastructure (`pytest-homeassistant-custom-component`)
- **Dev Tooling** - Mock server with `--auth-type` and `--delay` flags, HA reload script, E2E test framework, pre-push hooks (#20)

## [3.12.1] - 2026-01-20

### Fixed

- **HNAP Modem Setup** - Fixed `AssertionError` during discovery when setting up HNAP modems (MB8611, S33). The discovery pipeline now correctly handles HNAP authentication which returns JSON API responses rather than HTML pages. (#102)

## [3.12.0] - 2026-01-20

### ✨ Auth Strategy Discovery

v3.12.0 introduces Auth Strategy Discovery, a major architectural improvement that automatically detects and stores authentication requirements during initial setup. This eliminates hard-coded parser-specific authentication logic and improves reliability for modems with firmware variants.

### Added

- **Auth Strategy Discovery** - During config flow, the integration now probes the modem to discover which authentication method works (Basic HTTP, Form-based, HNAP/SOAP, URL Token, or No Auth)
- **Stored Auth Configuration** - The discovered auth strategy is stored in config entry and reused during polling, ensuring consistent authentication
- **Parser Hints** - Parsers now provide `hnap_hints`, `js_auth_hints`, and `auth_form_hints` for auth discovery
- **AuthHandler Improvements** - All authentication is now handled centrally by AuthHandler, not individual parsers

### Changed

- **BREAKING (Internal)**: Parsers no longer implement `login()` method directly. All auth is handled by `AuthHandler`
- **SB8200 Auth**: URL token authentication now uses session cookies instead of parser-stored tokens
- **S33/MB8611 HNAP**: HNAP builder is now created by AuthHandler and transferred to parser for data fetches
- **Fixture Organization**: Modem fixtures moved from `tests/parsers/` to `modems/{manufacturer}/{model}/fixtures/` with new `modem.yaml` schema for declarative modem configuration

### Fixed

- **SB6190 Auth Detection** - Combined credential forms with visible password fields now detected correctly (#83, #93)
- **Form Auth Response Handling** - Auth handler now returns `None` instead of form response HTML, allowing scraper to fetch actual data pages
- **Invalid Auth Error Display** - Bad credentials now show "Invalid username or password" instead of misleading "Cannot connect" error
- **Options Flow Auth Handling** - Options/reconfigure flow now properly catches authentication errors
- **Polling Log Noise** - Detection and connection success logs demoted from INFO to DEBUG (only visible when debugging enabled)
- **Misleading Parser Names** - Removed parser name from connection log that incorrectly showed URL pattern source instead of detected modem

### Improved

- **Error Messages** - Simplified authentication error message across all 12 languages
- **Conditional Logging** - Config flow uses verbose logging (INFO) for setup visibility, polling uses quiet logging (DEBUG) for normal operation

### Technical Details

Auth strategies supported:

- `NO_AUTH` - No authentication required
- `BASIC_HTTP` - HTTP Basic authentication
- `FORM_PLAIN` - Form POST with plain credentials
- `FORM_BASE64` - Form POST with base64-encoded credentials
- `HNAP_SESSION` - HNAP/SOAP challenge-response authentication
- `URL_TOKEN_SESSION` - URL-based token with session cookies

## [3.11.0] - 2025-12-27

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGE: Channel Sensor Entity IDs

Channel sensor entity IDs now include channel type for DOCSIS 3.1 disambiguation.

**Before:**

```text
sensor.cable_modem_ds_ch_32_power
sensor.cable_modem_us_ch_3_power
```

**After:**

```text
sensor.cable_modem_ds_qam_ch_32_power
sensor.cable_modem_ds_ofdm_ch_1_power
sensor.cable_modem_us_atdma_ch_3_power
sensor.cable_modem_us_ofdma_ch_1_power
```

**Why:** DOCSIS 3.1 modems can have overlapping Channel IDs across different channel types (QAM vs OFDM). Adding the channel type to the entity ID prevents collisions and makes entities unambiguous.

**Migration for DOCSIS 3.0 users:**

1. Go to Settings → Integrations → Cable Modem Monitor → Configure
2. Click Submit (no changes needed)
3. Entities are automatically migrated on reload, preserving history

**Migration for DOCSIS 3.1 users:**

1. Go to Developer Tools → Services
2. Call `cable_modem_monitor.generate_dashboard`
3. Copy the YAML output and replace your existing dashboard cards

### Added

- **Automatic Entity Migration for DOCSIS 3.0** - Existing entities are automatically migrated to the new naming scheme for DOCSIS 3.0 modems. Since DOCSIS 3.0 only has one channel type per direction (QAM downstream, ATDMA upstream), the migration is unambiguous and preserves entity history. Trigger migration by opening the integration's Configure dialog and clicking Submit.
- **Channel Type in Entity IDs** - All channel sensors now include channel type (qam, ofdm, atdma, ofdma) for DOCSIS 3.1 compatibility
- **Dashboard Channel Grouping** - `generate_dashboard` service now accepts `channel_grouping` parameter:
  - `by_direction` (default) - All downstream channels in one card, all upstream in another
  - `by_type` - Separate cards for each channel type (QAM, OFDM, ATDMA, OFDMA)
- **Smart Channel Labels** - `generate_dashboard` service now accepts `channel_label` parameter:
  - `auto` (default) - Smart labeling: type in title when single type, type in labels when mixed
  - `full` - Labels like "QAM Ch 32"
  - `id_only` - Labels like "Ch 32"
  - `type_id` - Labels like "QAM 32"
- **Channel Attributes** - Each channel sensor now exposes `channel_id`, `channel_type`, and `frequency` as state attributes
- **Downstream Frequency Graph** - `generate_dashboard` service now accepts `include_downstream_frequency` parameter
- **Technicolor CGA2121 Parser** - New parser for Technicolor CGA2121 gateways (#75)
- **Arris G54 Parser** - New parser for Arris G54 gateway devices (#72)
- **Session Logout Support** - Parsers can now define `logout_endpoint` for modems that only allow one authenticated session (e.g., Netgear C3700)
- **Auto-Generate Attribution** - Fixture metadata now automatically generates contributor attribution

### Changed

- **Entity ID Format** - Channel sensors use `ds_{type}_ch_{id}` format instead of `ds_ch_{id}`
- **Sensor Names** - Channel sensors now display type in name (e.g., "DS QAM Ch 32 Power")

### Fixed

- **Arris S33 Parser** - Removed incorrect uptime mapping, fixed frequency parsing (#32)
- **CM1200 Channel Type Detection** - Fixed OFDM/OFDMA channels not showing correctly; parser now includes channel_type for downstream channels, and coordinator checks all relevant fields (channel_type, modulation, is_ofdm) (#63)

### Technical

- **Channel Normalization** - Coordinator normalizes channel_type from parser data (is_ofdm, modulation, channel_type fields)
- **Frequency-Based Indexing** - Channels are sorted by frequency within each type for stable index assignment

### Upgrade Notes

To enable new features added in v3.11 (actual model display in device info, ICMP detection for health monitoring), go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Cable Modem Monitor → Configure → Submit**. This triggers a fresh validation that populates the new config fields. This is a good practice after any upgrade to pick up new configuration options.

## [3.10.2] - 2025-12-18

### CRITICAL HOTFIX

⚠️ **v3.10.1 is broken** - A BFG history rewrite accidentally replaced `#` comment characters with `***REMOVED***` in the released code, causing SyntaxError on startup for all users.

## [3.2.0] - 2025-11-13

### Added

- **Fallback Mode for Unsupported Modems** - Universal parser for modems without specific support
  - New `UniversalFallbackParser` that works with any cable modem
  - Manual selection via "Unknown Modem (Fallback Mode)" in dropdown
  - Provides 4 basic sensors: Connection Status, Health Status, Ping Latency, HTTP Latency
  - Status shows as "limited" to indicate reduced functionality
  - Enables HTML capture button for diagnostic data collection
  - Allows users to contribute HTML samples for future parser development
  - Priority 1 (lowest) - only used when explicitly selected, never auto-detected
- **Parser Issue Status** - New status for when known parser extracts no channel data
  - Handles edge cases: bridge mode, firmware changes, modem initialization
  - Clear diagnostic messages guide user troubleshooting
  - Different from unsupported (parser exists but returns no data)
- **Health Monitoring in Diagnostics** - Network connectivity checks included in diagnostic download
  - ICMP ping test results with latency
  - HTTP HEAD request test results with latency
  - Connection status (responsive/unresponsive)
  - Helps diagnose network vs. modem issues

### Changed

- **Health Status Terminology** - Changed from "healthy" to "responsive" for clarity
- **Modem Dropdown and Auto-Detect Sorting** - Unified to alphabetical order
  - Both dropdown and auto-detection now use same alphabetical sorting (manufacturer → name)
  - Generic parsers appear last within their manufacturer group
  - Priority field deprecated (backward compatible, no longer used for ordering)
  - Example order: MB7621, MB8611 (HNAP), MB8611 (Static), MB Series (Generic)

### Fixed

- **Blocking Import in Event Loop** - Eliminated 515ms delays when updating button entity state
  - Moved parser import check from `available` property to async setup
  - Created `_check_restart_support()` helper function
  - Used `hass.async_add_executor_job()` to run imports in thread pool
  - Cached availability at setup time instead of checking dynamically
  - Fixes Home Assistant warning: "Detected blocking call to import_module"
- **Sensor Availability in Fallback/Limited Modes** - Sensors now properly show as available
  - Fixed sensors incorrectly showing unavailable when in fallback or limited status
  - Availability now correctly checks for fallback/limited status in addition to normal/parser_issue
- **Config Flow Input Preservation** - Form now preserves user input on validation errors
  - Previously, form would reset all fields when validation failed
  - Now preserves host, username, password, and modem_choice when showing errors
  - Improved user experience when connection fails or validation errors occur
- **Error Message Formatting** - Added newlines and numbered lists for readability
  - Used `\n` newlines in error messages (may need CSS for rendering)
  - Numbered steps for multi-step instructions
  - Easier to read error guidance in config flow
- **Latency Sensor Precision** - Rounded to whole milliseconds instead of 6+ decimals
  - Changed from `42.837194` ms to `43` ms
  - More readable and appropriate precision for network latency
- **Restart Button Availability** - Graceful handling for modems without restart support
  - Fallback mode and unknown modems don't show restart button
  - Check moved to async setup to avoid blocking I/O
  - Clear indication when restart functionality is unavailable

### Security

- **Bandit Security Scanner Suppressions** - Addressed false positive warnings
  - Added `# nosec B105` comments to suppress 3 false positives:
    - `CONF_PASSWORD` constant (configuration key name, not password value)
    - `password_field` parameters (HTML form field names, not password values)
  - All 6 Bandit warnings addressed (3 suppressed false positives + 3 already mitigated)
  - XML parsing warnings already protected by required defusedxml==0.7.1 dependency
  - Security analysis confirms 0 real vulnerabilities

### Testing

- **All 319 Tests Passing** - Fixed test failures for v3.2.0 release
  - Updated `test_version_is_3_2_0` to expect VERSION = "3.2.0"
  - Updated `test_get_parsers_sorts_alphabetically` to check alphabetical sorting
  - Added `# noqa: C901` to suppress complexity warnings (4 functions)
  - Applied Black formatting across all modified files

### Technical Details

- **Files Modified**: `const.py`, `manifest.json`, `config_flow.py`, `parsers/__init__.py`, `button.py`, `modem_scraper.py`, `sensor.py`, `strings.json`, test files
- **Version**: Bumped from 3.1.0 to 3.2.0
- **Commits**: 40+ commits with fallback mode, UX improvements, and bug fixes
- **Compatibility**: No breaking changes, fully backward compatible

## [3.1.0] - 2025-11-11

### Added

- **Update Modem Data Button** - Manual refresh button for on-demand data updates
  - `button.cable_modem_update_data` - Triggers immediate coordinator refresh
  - Useful for verifying changes after modem configuration or troubleshooting
  - Complements automatic polling with user-controlled updates
  - Shows notification when update is triggered
- **HTML Capture for Diagnostics** - Capture raw modem HTML for support requests
  - `button.cable_modem_capture_html` - Captures raw HTML responses from modem
  - Stores captured data in memory for 5 minutes with automatic expiry
  - Automatically sanitizes sensitive data (MACs, serials, passwords, private IPs)
  - Included in diagnostics download when available
  - Makes requesting support for unsupported modems much easier
  - Notification shows capture status and reminds user to download diagnostics
  - Diagnostic button category - grouped with other diagnostic tools

### Fixed

- **MB8611 Static Parser Missing URL Patterns** - Fixed "No URL patterns available to try" error (Fixes #6)
  - Added missing `url_patterns` attribute to `MotorolaMB8611StaticParser` class
  - Parser now properly specifies `/MotoStatusConnection.html` as the data source URL
  - Without this attribute, the modem scraper had no URLs to fetch, causing immediate failure
  - Users can now successfully use the "Motorola MB8611 (Static)" parser option
- **SSL Certificate Verification Issue** - Fixed HTTPS connection failures for modems with self-signed certificates (Fixes #6)
  - Added explicit `verify=session.verify` parameter to all HTTP requests in authentication.py (6 locations)
  - Added explicit `verify=session.verify` parameter to all HTTP requests in hnap_builder.py (2 locations)
  - While `session.verify=False` was already configured, some requests library versions may not reliably inherit this setting
  - Ensures SSL verification setting is explicitly passed to every HTTP request for consistent behavior
  - Resolves HTTPS connection failures for Motorola MB8611 and other modems using self-signed certificates
- **Diagnostics Log Retrieval** - Improved log collection for diagnostics downloads
  - Added primary method: retrieve logs from Home Assistant's system_log integration (in-memory circular buffer)
  - Falls back to reading home-assistant.log file if system_log unavailable
  - Fixes issue where diagnostics showed "Log file not available" on Docker/supervised installations
  - Fixed 'tuple' object has no attribute 'name' error by correctly parsing system_log tuple format
  - Discovered system_log only stores errors/warnings, not INFO/DEBUG logs (by design)
  - Updated to correctly parse tuple format: (logger_name, (file, line_num), exception_or_none)
  - Better error messages explain that full logs require HA logs UI, journalctl, or container logs
  - Will capture cable_modem_monitor errors when they occur for troubleshooting
- **Version Logging on Startup** - Integration now logs version number when it starts
  - Example: "Cable Modem Monitor version 3.1.0 is starting"
  - Helps identify which version is loaded when troubleshooting issues
  - Makes it easy to confirm integration loaded properly from diagnostic logs

### Performance

- **Parser Loading Optimization** - Dramatically faster integration startup and modem restarts
  - When user selects specific modem: load only that parser (8x faster than scanning all parsers)
  - Auto-detection mode: scan filesystem once, cache results for subsequent loads (instant)
  - Restart button: uses same optimization as startup
  - Added `get_parser_by_name()` function for direct parser loading without discovery
  - Added global parser cache to avoid repeated filesystem scans
  - Parser discovery now only runs during config flow and first auto-detection
- **Protocol Discovery Optimization** - Skips HTTP/HTTPS protocol fallback when working URL is cached
  - First setup: tries HTTPS→HTTP fallback, saves working URL with protocol
  - Subsequent startups: extracts protocol from cached URL, uses it directly
  - Eliminates failed connection attempts on HTTP-only modems (faster, cleaner logs)
  - Config changes automatically re-detect protocol when user clicks Submit
  - Particularly beneficial for older HTTP-only modems that previously logged HTTPS errors

### Removed

- **v1.x to v2.0 Entity Migration Code** - Removed automatic entity ID migration from legacy versions
  - Deleted 127 lines of migration code that ran on every startup
  - Removed: `async_migrate_entity_ids()`, `_migrate_config_data()`, and helper functions
  - Users still on v1.x can perform clean reinstall (see UPGRADING.md)
  - Reduces startup overhead and code complexity
  - Migration was for v2.0.0 (released Oct 24, 2025) - no longer needed at v3.1.0

### Testing

- **Comprehensive Test Coverage for v3.1.0 Features** - Added 20+ new test cases
  - UpdateModemDataButton tests (initialization, press, notification)
  - CaptureHtmlButton tests (success, failure, exception handling)
  - HTML sanitization tests (13 test cases covering MACs, serials, IPs, passwords, tokens)
  - Diagnostics integration tests (capture inclusion, expiry, sanitization verification)
  - Updated button setup test to verify all 5 buttons
- **Fixed 5 Failing Tests in test_version_and_startup.py** - All 283 tests now pass
  - Fixed HomeAssistant mock setup with proper attributes (data, config_entries, services)
  - Made async_add_executor_job properly execute functions and return awaitable results
  - Added async mocks for coordinator.async_config_entry_first_refresh
  - Patched _update_device_registry to avoid deep HA registry initialization
  - Added ConfigEntryState.SETUP_IN_PROGRESS to mock config entries
  - All version logging and parser selection optimization tests now pass

### Technical Details

- **Files Modified**: `mb8611_static.py`, `authentication.py`, `hnap_builder.py`, `diagnostics.py`, `__init__.py`, `button.py`, `parsers/__init__.py`, `modem_scraper.py`, `const.py`, `manifest.json`
- **HTML Capture Implementation**: Added `capture_raw` parameter to `get_modem_data()` and `_fetch_data()` methods, stores raw HTML in coordinator data with 5-minute TTL, sanitization removes MACs/serials/passwords/IPs while preserving signal data for debugging
- **Test Coverage**: Added `test_diagnostics.py` (28 tests) and expanded `test_button.py` (+6 tests, 669 lines total)
- **Root Cause**: The Static parser implementation was incomplete - it had parsing logic but no URL configuration
- **Impact**: Fixes both the "no URL patterns" error and HTTPS authentication issues for MB8611 and similar modems
- **Diagnostics**: Now works reliably across all Home Assistant installation types (Docker, supervised, core, OS)
- **Performance**: 8x faster startup when specific modem selected, instant startup for cached auto-detection
- **Compatibility**: No breaking changes, fully backward compatible with existing configurations

- **Standardized Logging** - Updated all logging statements to use standard string formatting instead of f-strings for consistency and performance.

### Changed

- **Modem Restart Reliability** - The `restart_modem` function is now more robust.
  - It always re-fetches connection data before a restart to detect if the modem has fallen back from HTTPS to HTTP, ensuring the correct protocol is used.
  - It now attempts to log in before sending the restart command if credentials are provided, improving compatibility with modems that require authentication for restart functionality.
- **Motorola Parser Security** - Improved the security of the Motorola parser's login mechanism by allowing redirects only within private IP address ranges, preventing open redirect vulnerabilities while still accommodating local network device behavior.

### Added

- The root cause was a key name mismatch introduced during v2.0 refactoring
- `modem_scraper.py` returns `cable_modem_connection_status` but `config_flow.py` was checking `connection_status`
- Since `.get()` returns `None` for missing keys, validation incorrectly passed
- Users could "successfully" configure the integration but all entities remained unavailable

## [2.4.1] - 2025-10-29

### Added

- **Parser Priority System** - Model-specific parsers now tried before generic parsers
  - Ensures MB7621 uses its specific parser instead of generic Motorola parser

## [2.0.0] - 2025-10-24

### Breaking Changes

- **Entity Naming Standardization** - All sensor entity IDs now use the hard-coded `cable_modem_` prefix
  - **Before (v1.x)**: Entity IDs could vary (no prefix or domain prefix)
  - **After (v2.0)**: All entity IDs consistently use `sensor.cable_modem_*` format
  - Automatic migration included - entity IDs will be renamed on first startup
  - Configuration options for entity prefixes have been removed
  - See UPGRADING.md for detailed migration guide

### Added

- **Automatic Entity ID Migration** - Seamlessly upgrades entity IDs from pre-v2.0 to v2.0 naming
  - Runs automatically on integration startup
  - Includes safety checks to prevent conflicts with other integrations
  - Logs all migrations for debugging
  - Preserves history where possible (some loss may occur due to database conflicts)
- **Enhanced Configuration Descriptions** - Detailed field descriptions in options flow
  - Clear instructions for password handling (leave blank to keep existing)
  - Current host/username displayed for context
  - Helpful descriptions for scan interval and history retention settings

### Changed

- **Simplified Configuration Flow** - Reduced from two steps to single-step options flow
  - Entity naming configuration removed (now hard-coded)
  - Cleaner, more intuitive configuration experience
- **Industry-Standard Sensor Names** - Channel sensors use DS/US abbreviations following industry standards
  - Downstream: "Downstream Ch 1 Power" → "DS Ch 1 Power"
  - Upstream: "Upstream Ch 1 Power" → "US Ch 1 Power"
  - Shorter names reduce redundancy in dashboard cards
  - Follows cable industry standard abbreviations (DS = Downstream, US = Upstream)
  - Entity IDs remain unchanged (still include downstream/upstream in the ID)
- **Improved Code Quality** - Code review and cleanup
  - Removed unused imports
  - Fixed SQL injection potential with parameterized queries
  - Added clarity comments explaining v2.0+ parser architecture
  - Better documentation throughout codebase

### Fixed

- **Upstream Channel Sensors** - Fixed upstream sensors not being created
  - Relaxed validation to allow upstream channels without frequency data
  - Fixed Motorola parser reading frequency from wrong column (was column 2, now column 5)
  - Fixed power reading from wrong column (was column 3, now column 6)
  - Upstream frequencies now display correctly in Hz
  - Only active "Locked" channels are shown (inactive "Not Locked" channels are filtered out)
  - Resolves issue where no upstream sensors appeared despite modem reporting 5 active channels

### Technical

- Added `async_migrate_entity_ids()` function in **init**.py for automatic migration
- Simplified config_flow.py to single-step options flow
- Removed deprecated CONF_ENTITY_PREFIX and related constants
- Updated sensor display names to use DS/US prefixes
- Updated clear_history service to use parameterized SQL queries
- All parser comments now reference v2.0+ (v1.8 was never released)
- Modified `base_parser.validate_upstream()` to make frequency optional
- Fixed Motorola MB parser upstream channel column indices
- Added filtering for "Not Locked" upstream channels in Motorola parser

### Migration Notes

- **Recommended**: Fresh install (cleanest approach)
- **Alternative**: Automatic migration will rename entities on first startup
- **History**: Some history loss may occur during migration due to database conflicts
- **Orphaned Data**: Old records from renamed entities persist - use clear_history service to clean up
- **Documentation**: See UPGRADING.md for complete migration guide

## [1.7.1] - 2025-10-23

### Fixed

- **Nested Table Parsing** - Fixed HTML parsing for modems with nested table structures
